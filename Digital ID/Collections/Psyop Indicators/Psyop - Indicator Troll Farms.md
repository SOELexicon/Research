# Psyop - Indicator Troll Farms

## Description

Troll farms are organized groups of human operators using fake online personas (sockpuppets) to inject divisive narratives, harass opponents, and poison online discourse as part of coordinated influence operations. Unlike bot networks, troll farms rely on human creativity and adaptability to create more sophisticated and contextually appropriate content for psychological manipulation.

## Key Characteristics

### Organized Human Operations
- **Coordinated Personnel**: Teams of human operators working under central direction
- **Shift Patterns**: Organized work schedules ensuring 24/7 online presence

### Sophisticated Persona Management
- **Detailed Backstories**: Comprehensive fictional identities with believable personal histories
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Personas crafted to appear as genuine members of target communities
- **Long-Term Development**: Accounts maintained over extended periods to build credibility
- **Relationship Building**: Operators develop genuine relationships to enhance authenticity

### Strategic Content Creation
- **Narrative Injection**: Introduction of specific talking points and divisive themes
