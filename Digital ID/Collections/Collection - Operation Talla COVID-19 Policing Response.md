# Collection - Operation Talla COVID-19 Policing Response

## Overview
Operation Talla was the United Kingdom's national policing response framework to the COVID-19 pandemic, initiated in early 2020. It coordinated efforts across all UK police forces to manage enforcement of lockdown measures, public safety, custody procedures, and law and order during the pandemic using the Gold/Silver/Bronze command structure.

## Operational Framework

2. Ensure public safety during lockdown measures
3. Maintain law and order during unprecedented restrictions
4. Provide mutual aid among police forces
5. Disseminate national guidance on COVID-19 policing
6. Manage custody procedures during pandemic
7. Coordinate communications strategies

### "4Es" Policing Approach
- **Engage:** Engage with the public about regulations
- **Explain:** Explain the health regulations and reasons
- **Encourage:** Encourage voluntary compliance
- **Enforce:** Enforce as last resort

## Activities and Operations

### Enforcement Activities
- Lockdown regulation enforcement
- Social distancing policing
- Essential travel checks
- Gathering and assembly dispersal
- Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) issuance
- Business closure enforcement

### Operational Procedure Modifications (Jersey Example)

**Drink/Drive Enforcement (March 26, 2020):**
Official Jersey guidance document shows how Operation Talla affected standard policing procedures:

**Equipment Unavailability:**
- Roadside screening devices: NOT AVAILABLE
- Intoxilyzer breath analysis device: NOT AVAILABLE
- Reason given: Coronavirus (COVID-19) / Operation TALLA

**Procedure Adaptations:**
- Subjective assessment based on officer observation and experience
- Required "clear signs of alcoholic intoxication" for arrest
- Blood or urine specimens required instead of breath analysis
- Forms modified to note "SCREENING TEST: Unavailable"
- Device availability marked as "NO" with reason "Coronavirus (COVID-19)"

**Quote from Official Guidance:**
> "During the time that Operation TALLA is in force it has been decided that the Road Side Screening devices and the Intoxilyzer device for breath analysis are not available for use. This is a lawful and entirely reasonable decision..."

**Acknowledged Consequences:**
> "The lack of the ability to screen test suspects or drivers involved in collisions or committing traffic offences will result in some drivers evading detection of prescribed limit offences. That will be unavoidable during this period."

**Significance:**
- Shows Operation Talla directly modified standard enforcement procedures
- Equipment deemed unavailable due to COVID-19 concerns
- Reduced enforcement capability accepted as "unavoidable"
- Documented trade-offs between pandemic precautions and law enforcement effectiveness

## NPCC Publication Strategy: Information Control Infrastructure (March 2020)

### Centralized FOI Control Framework

**Official NPCC Document (March 9-12, 2020):**
The NPCC Operation Talla Publication Strategy provides definitive primary source evidence of centralized information control mechanisms.

**Mandatory Referral Process:**
> "All FOI requests capturing information relating to the Coronavirus, are until further notice, considered to be a **mandatory referral to the NPCC Freedom of Information and Data Protection Unit (NPFDU)** as per College of Policing Authorised Professional Practice (APP), **a process all chief officers are signed up to.**"

**Key Elements:**
1. **Centralized Gatekeeping:** ALL COVID-19 FOI requests must be referred to NPCC
2. **National Corporate View:** NPCC provides coordinated response baseline
3. **Communications Coordination:** NPCC communications team informed of every request
4. **Cross-Force Consistency:** All forces must follow national strategy

### Section 22 Exemption Strategy

**Strategic Publication Delays:**
NPCC pre-committed to future publication (July 2022+) to enable all forces to claim Section 22 FOI exemption

**Benefits Stated:**
- "Remove predicted demand" (reduce FOI workload)
- Prevent "random piecemeal disclosures" that "may damage strategic aims"
- Create **"sterile period"** for stakeholder coordination
- "Mitigate harm from random incomplete information entering public domain"

### Information Delayed Until July 2022 (2+ Years)

**Categories Withheld:**
- Financial information (overtime costs)
- Mutual aid requests and requirements
- Operation Talla Independent Ethics Committee deliberations and "dilemmas"
- Hate crime data (COVID-19 related)
- PPE costs, suppliers, distribution, procurement
- Recruitment (returnees)
- Comprehensive enforcement data

### Operation Talla Independent Ethics Committee

**Existence Confirmed:**
Official document references "Operation Talla Independent Ethics Committee"

**Transparency Delayed:**
"Summary documents (outlining discussions and advice) and **dilemmas** given by the Operation Talla Independent Ethics Committee" - Publication delayed until July 2022

**Implications:**
- Ethics committee was established
- "Dilemmas" arose requiring ethical guidance
- Public denied real-time transparency about ethical concerns
- Democratic oversight impossible during operation

### ACRO Centralization Confirmed

**Document States:**
FPN data publication "not before conclusion of FPN processing by **ACRO**"

**Confirms:** ACRO operated as centralized FPN processing agency for all forces

### Validation of Ethical Approach UK Findings

| EA UK Finding | NPCC Document Confirmation |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| "Information control, top-down communication centralisation" | ✅ Mandatory FOI referral to NPCC; "national corporate view" |
| "Strategic communication units" | ✅ NPCC communications team informed of all FOI requests |
| "Institutional resistance to transparency" | ✅ Section 22 delays; "sterile period"; July 2022 publication |
| "ACRO as centralised FPN issuing agency" | ✅ ACRO named as centralized FPN processor |
| "Not merely a policing operation, but structural reconfiguration" | ✅ National coordination; ethics committee; multi-year information management |

**EA UK Conclusion:**
> "Operation Talla functioned as a civil command prototype to enforce compliance, shape public perception, and prepare security infrastructure for future crisis-triggered governance models."

**NPCC Document Evidence:**
- "Strategic aims" protected by information control
- "Harm" prevented by managing public information
- "Sterile period" for stakeholder coordination
- Multi-year transparency delays
- Independent ethics committee with undisclosed "dilemmas"

**Assessment:** EA UK investigation findings **SUBSTANTIALLY VALIDATED** by official NPCC primary source documentation

## Assessment

### Verified Information
✅ Operation Talla was UK's national COVID-19 policing framework
✅ Coordinated via Gold/Silver/Bronze command structure
✅ Involved all UK police forces
✅ Enforced lockdown regulations
✅ Managed custody procedures during pandemic
✅ NPCC provided guidance and coordination
✅ Awards presented for exceptional service

### Unverified Claims
❓ Information suppression directives regarding midazolam
❓ Deliberate communications management about treatments
