## Relevance to Investigation
EU Member States are critical because:
- Mandatory eIDAS 2.0 implementation by May 2026
- Cross-border digital identity recognition requirements
- Coordinated surveillance infrastructure development
- Harmonized technical standards implementation
- Privacy law conflicts with digital ID requirements

## Implementation Status
- **Advanced**: Germany, France, Netherlands, Estonia
- **Developing**: Italy, Spain, Belgium, Austria
- **Early Stage**: Eastern European members
- **Resistance**: Some constitutional challenges emerging

## Key Obligations
- Provide EUDI Wallets to all citizens
- Ensure cross-border interoperability
- Integrate with large online platforms
- Implement browser security controls
- Share data for law enforcement

## Collective Impact
- **Population**: 450+ million EU citizens affected
- **Economic**: â‚¬10+ billion implementation costs
- **Privacy**: GDPR conflicts with surveillance requirements
- **Democratic**: Limited citizen input on implementation
