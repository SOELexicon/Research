# **Stratospheric Aerosol Injection: A Comprehensive Analysis of Proposed Climate Intervention Technologies, Risks, and Governance Challenges**

### **Executive Summary**

Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) is a form of solar radiation management (SRM) and the most extensively researched geoengineering proposal for rapidly counteracting the effects of global warming. The concept, which involves dispersing reflective particles into the upper atmosphere to scatter a fraction of incoming sunlight back to space, is inspired by the temporary global cooling observed after large volcanic eruptions. Climate models consistently indicate that SAI could be highly effective, capable of limiting global temperature rise to specific targets, such as 1.5°C, and potentially mitigating some of the most severe climate impacts, including Arctic sea ice loss.  
However, SAI is not a solution to the root cause of climate change—the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is a symptomatic treatment that introduces a host of profound, complex, and poorly understood risks. The primary proposed material, sulfur dioxide, is known to cause significant depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, delaying the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole by decades. Furthermore, SAI would alter global weather patterns, leading to a slowdown of the hydrological cycle and potentially causing severe regional droughts, particularly impacting vital monsoon systems that support billions of people. Critically, SAI does nothing to halt ocean acidification, which would continue to worsen as long as carbon dioxide concentrations rise.  
Perhaps the most severe danger is the "termination shock": an abrupt cessation of a long-term SAI deployment would trigger a hyper-accelerated period of warming at a rate far exceeding the adaptive capacity of most ecosystems and human societies, creating a planetary "Sword of Damocles." The technology also presents unprecedented geopolitical challenges. Its relatively low cost could enable unilateral deployment by a single state or actor—a "free driver" scenario—creating regional climate winners and losers and elevating the risk of international conflict. The prospect of an "easy" technological fix also raises a significant "moral hazard," potentially undermining the global will to pursue the essential work of emissions reduction.  
The current state of international governance is wholly inadequate to manage these risks. There is no bespoke treaty for SAI, and existing international law is a poor fit. While research continues at institutions worldwide, early attempts at small-scale outdoor experiments, such as the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx), have been halted by significant public and Indigenous opposition, demonstrating that social and ethical considerations are as formidable as the scientific challenges. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the scientific basis of SAI, the materials under consideration, its potential benefits, its multifaceted risks, and the critical governance and ethical dilemmas it presents to the global community.

## **Section 1: The Scientific Foundation of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection**

This section establishes the fundamental scientific principles underpinning Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), grounding the concept in its natural analogue—volcanic eruptions—and detailing the proposed artificial mechanisms for implementation.

### **1.1 Principles of Solar Radiation Management (SRM)**

Stratospheric Aerosol Injection is a specific method within a broader category of proposed climate interventions known as Solar Radiation Management (SRM) or solar geoengineering.1 The fundamental goal of SRM techniques is to counteract the warming effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases by deliberately altering the Earth's radiative energy budget.3 Unlike carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies, which address the root cause of climate change by extracting greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, SRM aims only to treat the primary symptom: rising global temperatures.5  
The core physical principle of SRM is to increase the planet's albedo, or reflectivity.5 By reflecting a small fraction of incoming short-wave solar radiation back to space before it can be absorbed and trapped as heat by greenhouse gases, SRM methods seek to induce a net cooling effect at the Earth's surface and in the lower atmosphere (the troposphere).3 Scientific assessments suggest that SAI is the most prominent and extensively studied SRM method, possessing the theoretical potential for rapid and significant global cooling.7 Other proposed SRM techniques include Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB), which involves seeding low-level clouds with sea salt to make them more reflective, and Cirrus Cloud Thinning (CCT), which aims to allow more long-wave heat to escape into space.5

### **1.2 The Volcanic Analogue: Nature's Proof of Concept**

The scientific basis for SAI is derived directly from observations of large, explosive volcanic eruptions, which serve as a natural, albeit imperfect, analogue for the proposed technology.1 When a major volcano erupts, it injects enormous quantities of particles and gases into the atmosphere. While heavy volcanic ash can cause significant but temporary and localized cooling by shading the surface, these larger particles fall out of the atmosphere relatively quickly, typically within hours or days.12  
The climatically significant component of a volcanic plume is sulfur dioxide (SO2​) gas.12 Large eruptions can propel  
SO2​ high into the stratosphere, the atmospheric layer extending from approximately 12 to 50 km above the surface. In the dry and stable conditions of the stratosphere, the SO2​ gas chemically combines with water vapor to form a persistent haze of microscopic sulfuric acid (H2​SO4​) aerosols.12 These tiny liquid droplets are highly effective at scattering incoming sunlight. Winds then distribute this reflective aerosol layer around the globe, where it can remain suspended for several years, causing a measurable decrease in global average temperatures.1  
The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines is the most well-documented modern example. It injected an estimated 12 to 20 million tonnes of SO2​ into the stratosphere, which subsequently cooled the planet by approximately 0.6°C for up to two years.1 This event provides the primary empirical evidence that deliberately introducing sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere could have a powerful cooling effect on the global climate.7  
However, the reliance on this volcanic analogue has critical limitations that introduce profound uncertainty into predictions about SAI. Volcanic eruptions are massive, single-pulse injections into a relatively particle-free stratosphere.3 In contrast, an effective SAI deployment would require continuous or frequent injections over many decades to maintain its cooling effect against the backdrop of rising greenhouse gas concentrations.3 This means that new aerosols would be introduced into a stratospheric environment already laden with pre-existing particles from prior injections.3 This existing aerosol layer would act as a "condensation sink," causing newly formed gaseous sulfuric acid to condense onto larger, existing particles rather than nucleating to form new, smaller ones. This process leads to an aerosol layer composed of fewer, larger particles.3 Since larger particles are less efficient at scattering sunlight per unit of mass, the cooling effect of SAI does not increase linearly with the amount of sulfur injected; it is subject to a law of diminishing returns.3 This non-linear effect, which cannot be accurately predicted by studying isolated volcanic events, complicates any cost-benefit analysis and represents a major uncertainty in deployment scenarios. It suggests that simply scaling up injections to counteract greater levels of warming may become progressively less effective.

### **1.3 Proposed SAI Mechanisms and Deployment**

Transitioning from the natural analogue, the proposed mechanism for SAI involves the deliberate and sustained delivery of reflective aerosol particles, or their gaseous precursors, into the stratosphere.13 The targeted altitude for injection is typically between 13 and 25 km, well within the stratospheric layer.10  
The choice of the stratosphere is strategic. This layer is exceptionally dry, stable, and largely free of the weather phenomena, such as clouds and rain, that characterize the lower troposphere.1 This stability allows injected particles to have a long atmospheric residence time—lasting from several months to a few years—before gravitational settling eventually returns them to the troposphere and the Earth's surface. In contrast, any particles released into the troposphere would be washed out by precipitation within a matter of days.1 This extended residence time is what enables a relatively small mass of injected material to form a persistent, globally distributed reflective layer.  
Several delivery systems have been proposed to transport the aerosol material to the required altitude. The most commonly assumed and analyzed method involves a fleet of specially designed high-altitude aircraft capable of flying at 20 km or more.14 Other potential methods include high-altitude balloons, artillery shells, and tall towers.1 Recent research has explored the feasibility of using existing aircraft for injections at lower altitudes (around 13 km), but only in the polar regions. While this approach could be implemented more quickly, simulations show it would be about one-third as effective as higher-altitude equatorial injections. Consequently, it would require three times the amount of aerosol to achieve the same global cooling effect, significantly increasing potential side effects such as acid rain.14

## **Section 2: A Comparative Analysis of Proposed Aerosol Candidates**

The effectiveness and side effects of any SAI deployment would depend critically on the specific material injected into the stratosphere. This section provides a comparative analysis of the leading aerosol candidates, from the volcanically inspired sulfur dioxide to alternative mineral and engineered particles. It also serves to authoritatively distinguish these scientific proposals from widespread misinformation.

### **2.1 Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂): The Primary Candidate**

Sulfur dioxide (SO2​) is the most frequently analyzed precursor gas for SAI, primarily because its role in climate cooling is directly observable from volcanic eruptions and thus is the best-understood option.12 Upon injection into the stratosphere, gaseous  
SO2​ undergoes oxidation to form sulfuric acid (H2​SO4​), which then condenses with water vapor to form a fine mist of reflective liquid sulfate aerosol droplets.12  
These sulfate aerosols are highly effective at scattering incoming short-wave solar radiation, thereby increasing the Earth's albedo and producing a cooling effect.12 While climate models exhibit significant diversity in their predictions depending on the model's physics and the specific injection strategy (e.g., altitude, latitude, and timing), a commonly cited estimate suggests that the continuous annual injection of 8 to 16 Tg of  
SO2​ could produce approximately 1°C of global cooling.7 This injection rate is roughly equivalent to one Mount Pinatubo eruption per year.7 However, the actual radiative forcing achieved is highly sensitive to the resulting aerosol particle size, which is influenced by the non-linear effects of continuous injection, making precise predictions challenging.3

### **2.2 Alternative Mineral and Engineered Particles**

The significant and well-documented risks associated with sulfate aerosols, particularly their destructive effect on the ozone layer, have spurred research into alternative materials. This search for a "safer" aerosol reveals a deep recognition within the scientific community that the primary candidate may have unacceptable side effects, framing the challenge as a choice between different sets of potentially severe risks.

#### **Calcite (CaCO₃)**

One of the most innovative proposals involves the use of alkaline mineral particles, specifically calcite (CaCO3​), the primary component of limestone.20 The hypothesis behind using calcite is that it could simultaneously cool the planet and repair existing environmental damage. As an alkaline (or basic) substance, calcite is theorized to neutralize the primary stratospheric acids—sulfuric acid (  
H2​SO4​), nitric acid (HNO3​), and hydrochloric acid (HCl)—that are key reservoirs for the chemical radicals that catalytically destroy ozone.21 By converting these acids into stable salts (e.g.,  
CaSO4​), calcite could potentially reduce ozone depletion or even help restore the ozone layer toward its pre-industrial state.21  
Furthermore, modeling studies suggest that calcite aerosols would absorb far less radiation than sulfates, causing significantly less warming of the lower stratosphere.21 This is a crucial advantage, as stratospheric heating can alter atmospheric circulation patterns and increase the amount of water vapor in the stratosphere, which itself exacerbates ozone loss.21 While promising in theory, the chemistry of calcite in the complex stratospheric environment is subject to large uncertainties, including the potential for unintended chemical byproducts.20

#### **"Heavy Metals" and Engineered Nanoparticles**

The user query regarding "heavy metals" points toward a more speculative and far less understood category of proposed materials. Scientific and engineering literature has explored the theoretical use of various other substances, including metallic aluminum, aluminum oxide (alumina), barium titanate, and even diamond dust, often as components of specially engineered nanoparticles.15  
The theoretical appeal of such materials lies in the possibility of engineering particles with superior optical properties for scattering sunlight or with unique physical properties. For example, some have proposed designing nanoparticles that could "self-levitate" in the stratosphere by harnessing photophoretic forces (the movement of particles induced by light), which could dramatically increase their atmospheric residence time and reduce the mass of material needed for injection.15  
However, these proposals remain highly theoretical and are accompanied by profound knowledge gaps. There is virtually no research on the potential toxicity of these materials to humans and ecosystems once they inevitably fall out of the atmosphere and enter the biosphere.15 Their complex chemical interactions in the stratosphere are also largely unknown.25 Recent measurements have already detected metals like aluminum and lithium in stratospheric aerosols, originating from the burn-up of re-entering satellites and rocket stages. The influence of this existing, albeit unintentional, metal contamination on atmospheric properties is currently unknown, highlighting the risks of deliberately adding more.28  
**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Proposed Stratospheric Aerosol Candidates**

| Feature | Sulfur Dioxide (precursor to Sulfuric Acid) | Calcite (CaCO₃) | Engineered Nanoparticles (e.g., Alumina) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Chemical Formula** | SO2​→H2​SO4​ | CaCO3​ | Al2​O3​, BaTiO3​, etc. |

| **Modeled Cooling Efficacy** | High, but with non-linear effects at higher concentrations. Approx. 1°C cooling for 8-16 Tg SO2​/year.3 | Potentially comparable to sulfates, but less studied. −1W⋅m−2 for 2.1 Tg/year.21 | Highly theoretical; depends on particle design. Potentially more efficient per unit mass.15 |

| **Impact on Stratospheric Ozone** | **Highly Destructive.** Catalyzes reactions that destroy ozone, delaying ozone hole recovery.7 | **Potentially Restorative.** Neutralizes ozone-depleting acids, potentially increasing total ozone column.21 | Uncertain. Believed to be less reactive than sulfates, but could still damage or unexpectedly alter ozone levels.25 |
| **Technological Readiness** | Low. Delivery systems are theoretical; non-linear effects are poorly constrained.3 | Very Low. Entirely conceptual and based on modeling; no experimental data.21 | Extremely Low. Entirely theoretical; nanoparticle manufacturing and delivery at scale is science fiction.15 |
| **Key Uncertainties** | Non-linear cooling efficiency; precise regional impacts on precipitation.3 | Reaction rates and pathways in the stratosphere; long-term stability and impacts of resulting salts.20 | Virtually everything: toxicity, environmental fate, atmospheric chemistry, cost, and efficacy.15 |

### **2.3 Distinguishing SAI from the "Chemtrails" Conspiracy Theory**

The user's query, linking a scientific proposal with unsubstantiated claims, highlights the critical need to distinguish clearly between the two. The historical context for this confusion is relevant; for decades, scientific discussions about geoengineering were conducted largely out of the public eye, partly due to fears that publicizing the topic would create a "moral hazard" and reduce the impetus for emissions cuts.30 This created an information vacuum that was partially filled by the "chemtrails" conspiracy theory, which began to circulate in the late 1990s, fueled in part by a 1996 U.S. Air Force report on weather modification.31 The theory co-opted kernels of scientific concepts—that governments were interested in weather modification and that scientists were considering materials like aluminum—and stripped them of all context, peer review, and risk assessment, embedding them within a narrative of secret, malicious, and ongoing deployment. This underscores how a lack of transparent scientific communication can contribute directly to public confusion and the spread of misinformation.  
A clear demarcation is essential:

* **Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)** is a **proposed** and **un-deployed** climate intervention strategy grounded in decades of peer-reviewed atmospheric science.13 Its operations would take place in the  
  **stratosphere** (altitudes above \~12 km). The materials considered (e.g., sulfur dioxide, calcite) are specific, and the single, publicly stated goal is to reflect sunlight to counteract global warming.13 The scientific community is actively debating its profound risks and uncertainties.  
* **The "Chemtrails" Conspiracy Theory** is a scientifically baseless belief that the long-lasting condensation trails (contrails) left by commercial and military aircraft are evidence of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program.31 These trails occur in the  
  **troposphere** (typical cruising altitudes of 8-12 km), and their persistence is a normal atmospheric phenomenon determined by ambient temperature and humidity, which allows the water vapor in engine exhaust to form and sustain ice crystals.31 The theory alleges nefarious and varied purposes (e.g., population control, psychological manipulation, biological warfare) and unsubstantiated materials ("biological agents," "polymers"). The global scientific community has repeatedly and universally debunked the "chemtrails" theory, confirming that the observed trails are normal contrails.31

## **Section 3: Potential Efficacy and Climate Benefits**

This section objectively presents the modeled potential of SAI to achieve its primary climate objectives, based on the existing body of scientific simulations. While the risks are profound, the consistent findings from climate models regarding SAI's potential efficacy are what make it such a compelling and contentious topic. This combination of high efficacy, speed, and relatively low direct implementation costs makes SAI a technologically and economically seductive option, especially in a world struggling to meet emissions reduction targets. This allure is precisely what fuels the intense debates surrounding its risks and governance, as its potential effectiveness is both its greatest promise and its most profound danger.

### **3.1 Global Temperature Reduction**

Across a wide range of climate models and research institutions, there is a high degree of scientific consensus that SAI could effectively limit or reverse global warming.1 By increasing the concentration of reflective aerosols in the stratosphere, SAI could produce a significant negative radiative forcing, directly counteracting the positive forcing from greenhouse gases and stabilizing global mean surface temperatures at specified targets, such as 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels.1  
One key application proposed for SAI is "peak-shaving".4 This strategy envisions a temporary and limited deployment of SAI to prevent global temperatures from "overshooting" critical climate thresholds while society accelerates decarbonization efforts. By blunting the worst impacts of a peak warming period, this approach could theoretically reduce the risk of triggering irreversible climate tipping points, such as the collapse of major ice sheets or widespread ecosystem dieback.4  
Furthermore, recent research has explored alternative physical mechanisms that could be even more efficient. One study using idealized climate models suggests that deploying *absorptive* aerosols (like black carbon) into the *upper* stratosphere (\~40 km altitude) could cool the planet an order of magnitude more efficiently per unit mass than conventional scattering aerosols in the lower stratosphere. These absorptive particles would warm the upper stratosphere at the altitude where outgoing infrared radiation is most sensitive to temperature, thereby enhancing the Earth's ability to radiate heat to space and directly weakening the greenhouse effect without altering CO₂ concentrations.33 This remains a highly theoretical concept with its own unique and unstudied risks.

### **3.2 Mitigation of Specific Climate Impacts**

Beyond simply lowering the global average temperature, climate models indicate that SAI could ameliorate some of the most dangerous regional consequences of climate change.

* **Arctic Sea Ice:** Multiple simulations, including those from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), show that a targeted SAI deployment could be highly effective at preventing the catastrophic loss of summer Arctic sea ice, a critical component of the global climate system whose disappearance would amplify regional and global warming.1  
* **Extreme Weather:** SAI is also projected to moderate some forms of extreme weather. Model simulations suggest it could reduce the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events over continents like Africa.34 Other studies indicate a potential reduction in the intensity of precipitation during tropical cyclone seasons and a decrease in the number of consecutive dry days in some desert regions.35

### **3.3 Secondary Atmospheric Effects**

In addition to the primary goal of reflecting sunlight, SAI would trigger secondary effects in the atmosphere, some of which could enhance its cooling potential. Research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has identified a significant indirect effect involving marine clouds. The sunlight scattered by stratospheric aerosols becomes more diffuse. When this diffuse light reaches low-level marine cloud decks, it can make them brighter and more reflective.10  
This "bonus" marine cloud brightening could substantially increase the overall cooling effectiveness of an SAI deployment. One model showed that an aerosol layer could increase the amount of diffuse radiation entering a cloud deck from 6.4% to 59.1%, increasing the cloud's reflectivity by as much as 10%. Since clouds cover approximately two-thirds of the Earth's surface on average, this indirect brightening effect could, under certain conditions, provide a larger cooling impact than the direct reflection from the stratospheric aerosols themselves.10

## **Section 4: A Multi-Domain Risk Assessment**

While models suggest high efficacy, SAI also presents a formidable array of risks and unintended consequences that span atmospheric, ecological, and geopolitical domains. The risks are not isolated but are deeply interconnected, capable of creating cascading failures where a problem in one domain triggers a crisis in another. A comprehensive assessment reveals that SAI may not solve the climate crisis but rather exchange one set of uncontrollable risks (from climate change) for another, potentially more complex and dangerous, set of anthropogenic risks.17

### **4.1 Atmospheric and Environmental Risks**

#### **Ozone Layer Depletion**

One of the most well-documented and severe risks of using sulfate aerosols—the primary candidate for SAI—is the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer.5 The surfaces of liquid sulfuric acid droplets provide an ideal chemical environment for heterogeneous reactions that convert stable, benign forms of chlorine and bromine (originating from human-made substances like chlorofluorocarbons) into highly reactive radicals that catalytically destroy ozone molecules.21  
Model simulations consistently show that a sustained sulfate SAI deployment would significantly delay the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole, which is otherwise projected to heal by mid-century under the Montreal Protocol. Projections indicate a delay of between 25 and 50 years.7 Furthermore, SAI could cause unprecedented chemical ozone depletion in the Arctic spring, with simulated losses of up to 5% of the total column ozone compared to a world without SAI.7 This would increase the amount of harmful ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation reaching the surface in populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere.37

#### **Hydrological Cycle Disruption**

SAI would not restore the climate to a pre-industrial state; it would create an entirely new and artificial climate state.4 A fundamental consequence of reducing incoming solar radiation is a weakening of the global hydrological cycle.34 Less energy at the surface means less evaporation, which in turn leads to a global mean reduction in precipitation.5  
While the global mean decrease might be modest, the regional impacts could be severe and highly variable.39 Climate models project significant and potentially devastating shifts in regional weather patterns. In particular, SAI is expected to weaken crucial monsoon systems in South Asia and West Africa, which provide essential water for agriculture and human consumption for billions of people.29 The inherent unevenness of these impacts is a primary source of geopolitical risk, as there may be no single deployment strategy that is beneficial, or even acceptable, for all nations. A scenario that provides cooling for one country could simultaneously trigger a catastrophic drought in another.40

#### **Termination Shock**

Arguably the most catastrophic risk associated with SAI is the "termination shock".43 Because stratospheric aerosols have a limited atmospheric lifetime of only a few years, any SAI deployment would need to be continuously maintained for as long as greenhouse gas concentrations remain dangerously high—potentially for centuries.15 This creates what has been termed a "planetary Sword of Damocles".17  
If a long-term deployment were ever to be abruptly terminated—for any reason, such as international conflict, economic collapse, a pandemic that disrupts supply chains, or simply a loss of political will—the full warming effect of the accumulated greenhouse gases, which had been masked by the aerosol shield, would emerge with unprecedented speed.44 This would trigger a period of hyper-accelerated global warming at a rate estimated to be up to 20 times faster than the current rate of climate change.29 Such a rapid climatic shift would far exceed the adaptive capacity of most natural ecosystems and human societies, likely leading to mass extinctions and widespread societal collapse.17

#### **Incomplete Climate Solution (Ocean Acidification)**

A critical limitation of SAI is that it only addresses one symptom of excess atmospheric carbon dioxide: warming. It does nothing to reduce the concentration of CO2​ itself.45 As a result, the "other  
CO2​ problem"—ocean acidification—would continue unabated and potentially worsen under an SAI regime that allows emissions to continue.46  
The ocean absorbs roughly a quarter of the CO2​ emitted into the atmosphere, causing a decrease in seawater pH. This ongoing acidification poses a severe threat to marine life, particularly calcifying organisms like corals, shellfish, and pteropods, which form the base of many marine food webs.46 By masking the warming signal, SAI could create a false sense of security while the fundamental health of the oceans continues to decline. Furthermore, some research suggests that the changes in atmospheric circulation induced by SAI could alter ocean currents and rainfall patterns over the ocean, potentially exacerbating ocean warming in certain regions and failing to stem sea-level rise.45

### **4.2 Human Health and Ecological Impacts**

The materials injected into the stratosphere would not remain there indefinitely. Through gravitational settling, they would eventually fall back into the troposphere and to the Earth's surface, with a range of potential health and ecological consequences.

#### **Direct Health Effects from Fallout**

The fallout of sulfate aerosols would contribute to an increase in acid deposition (acid rain), which can damage forests, crops, and aquatic ecosystems, as well as corrode buildings and monuments.40 More directly, sulfate particles contribute to the global burden of fine particulate matter (  
PM2.5​), a pollutant strongly linked in epidemiological studies to a variety of adverse health outcomes, including premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, aggravated asthma, and decreased lung function.49 While some studies suggest the direct mortality impact from SAI-related sulfate deposition might be small compared to the mortality benefits from reduced heat stress, the uncertainties are large.37 For alternative materials like aluminum, alumina, and barium titanate, there is a profound lack of toxicological data, representing a major and unquantified public health risk should they ever be deployed.15

#### **Complex Air Quality Feedbacks**

The overall impact of SAI on air quality and health is complex and non-linear. While surface cooling from SAI might reduce the formation of ground-level ozone, a harmful pollutant, thereby lowering ozone-related mortality, this benefit could be offset by other effects.37 For example, by altering precipitation patterns, SAI could lead to drier conditions in some regions, reducing the natural "washout" of other forms of particulate pollution (like dust and secondary organic aerosols) and thus increasing mortality from those sources.52 The ozone depletion caused by sulfate SAI would also lead to increased surface UV radiation, which is associated with a higher risk of skin cancers and cataracts.37

#### **Ecosystem Disruption**

SAI would fundamentally alter the quantity and quality of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. By scattering light, it would increase the proportion of diffuse radiation relative to direct radiation.10 This shift could have complex and unpredictable effects on ecosystems. While some crops and forest canopies might benefit from more diffuse light, which penetrates deeper into the foliage, other plants adapted to direct sunlight could be harmed.17 Combined with SAI-induced regional changes in temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture, this could disrupt agricultural productivity and the stability of natural ecosystems in ways that are currently very difficult to predict.17

### **4.3 Geopolitical and Societal Risks**

Beyond the physical risks, SAI introduces a suite of unprecedented geopolitical and societal challenges for which humanity is ill-prepared.

#### **The "Free Driver" Problem and Unilateral Deployment**

A defining feature of SAI is that its direct implementation costs are projected to be relatively low—on the order of billions of dollars per year, a fraction of the cost of global decarbonization or the damages from climate change.9 This creates a dangerous "free driver" problem: the technology could be within the financial and technical reach of a single powerful state, a coalition of smaller states, or even a wealthy non-state actor.42  
Such an actor, perhaps suffering disproportionately from climate impacts, could choose to deploy SAI unilaterally, without international consensus. Because the climatic effects would be global and highly uneven, this action would inevitably create winners and losers, with one nation's cooling potentially causing another's drought.42 This scenario would generate immense international tension, political instability, and could plausibly escalate to armed conflict—a "geoengineering war".17

#### **The Moral Hazard Dilemma**

A central ethical and political concern is the "moral hazard" or "mitigation deterrence" effect.42 The mere prospect of a seemingly quick, cheap, and easy technological fix for global warming could undermine the collective political will and societal motivation to undertake the difficult, systemic, and essential work of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.43  
This risk is not merely theoretical. Vested interests in the fossil fuel industry could exploit the promise of SAI as yet another excuse to delay meaningful climate action, thereby locking humanity into a longer-term dependence on fossil fuels and, consequently, a greater and more prolonged reliance on a risky, symptomatic treatment like SAI.55 While some empirical studies on public opinion have found mixed evidence for a strong moral hazard effect, the political risk remains a primary objection to advancing SAI research and development.56

#### **Systemic and Latent Catastrophic Risks**

Deploying SAI would represent a new and profound form of human intervention in the Earth system, tightly coupling global ecological, economic, and political systems in a novel and potentially brittle way.17 The continued, stable operation of an SAI program would depend on uninterrupted international cooperation, economic stability, and technological function for centuries. This creates a precarious condition of  
*latent risk*.17 A major global shock—such as a world war, a severe pandemic that disrupts supply chains, or a global financial collapse—could interrupt the deployment. This interruption would then trigger the latent risk of termination shock, compounding the initial catastrophe with a climatic one of unparalleled speed and severity.17 The system's stability would become dependent on the stability of human civilization itself.

## **Section 5: The State of Research and International Governance**

This section surveys the current landscape of SAI research, using the proposed Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) as a case study for the profound controversies involved. It also assesses the critical and widely acknowledged gap in international governance for this potentially world-altering technology.

### **5.1 Major Research Programs and Institutions**

Research into SAI has evolved from a niche academic pursuit into a more structured, albeit still limited, field of study involving government agencies, universities, and international collaborations.

* **Government Agencies:** In the United States, agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA are playing a key role, particularly in developing the observational and monitoring capabilities necessary to understand the stratosphere and to detect any potential unauthorized SAI deployments.4 NOAA is developing balloon-borne instruments to establish a global baseline of stratospheric aerosol concentrations, creating an early warning system for geoengineering activities.61  
* **National Research Centers:** The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, is a leader in climate modeling of SAI. Projects like the Geoengineering Large Ensemble (GLENS) use sophisticated Earth system models, such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM), to run large sets of simulations that explore the potential impacts and uncertainties of various SAI scenarios.1  
* **University Programs:** University-based research has been central to advancing the science and exploring the governance of SAI. The Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program (SGRP), which concluded in 2024, was a prominent interdisciplinary initiative that funded research across natural sciences, social sciences, and policy.30 It was also the primary backer of the SCoPEx experiment.  
* **International Collaboration:** Given the global nature of SAI, international coordination is essential. The Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) and the Assessing Responses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the Earth system (ARISE) project are key international efforts that coordinate standardized modeling experiments across different research institutions worldwide. This allows scientists to compare model results, understand inter-model differences, and build a more robust picture of the potential climatic responses to SAI.41

### **5.2 The Case of SCoPEx: A Microcosm of the Debate**

The proposed Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) serves as a landmark case study, illustrating that the progression of geoengineering research is not merely a technical or scientific question, but a deeply social, ethical, and political one.67

* **Scientific Goals:** SCoPEx was designed as a small-scale, outdoor scientific experiment. Its purpose was not to alter the climate, but to release a very small amount of material (less than 2 kg, initially planned as water or calcium carbonate) from a high-altitude balloon into a small patch of the stratosphere.67 The goal was to observe the resulting plume to study aerosol microphysics and atmospheric chemistry in a real-world environment. The data gathered would have been used to reduce key uncertainties in climate models that currently limit the ability to accurately predict the effects of SAI.71  
* **Controversy and Opposition:** Despite its modest scientific scale, the proposal ignited intense international controversy. SCoPEx became a symbolic flashpoint for the entire geoengineering debate.72 Environmental groups and some scientists argued that conducting the first outdoor SAI-related experiment would cross a critical threshold, legitimizing a dangerous technology and creating a "slippery slope" toward eventual deployment.68  
* **Indigenous Rights and Worldview:** The most powerful and ultimately decisive opposition came from the Saami Council, the representative body for the Indigenous Sámi people of Sweden, where a preliminary balloon test flight was planned in 2021\.72 The Saami Council's opposition was multifaceted. Procedurally, they objected to the profound lack of consultation, which they argued violated their rights as Indigenous peoples to free, prior, and informed consent for activities taking place on their ancestral lands.73 More fundamentally, their opposition was rooted in a clash of worldviews. They argued that geoengineering technologies like SAI represent a continuation of the same hubristic, extractivist, and technological "mastery over nature" mentality that caused the climate crisis in the first place. This stands in direct contradiction to an Indigenous worldview based on living in respect and harmony with the natural world.73  
* **Cancellation:** The powerful moral, ethical, and political arguments raised by the Saami Council, amplified by international environmental organizations and scientists, led to the cancellation of the Swedish test flight in 2021\. The entire SCoPEx project was officially and permanently ended by Harvard in March 2024\.64 The SCoPEx case sets a crucial precedent, demonstrating that public consent and social license, particularly from Indigenous and other frontline communities, are formidable hurdles for even small-scale outdoor research. It highlights that future research governance cannot be limited to technical risk assessment but must incorporate deep and meaningful public and ethical deliberation to achieve any form of legitimacy.

### **5.3 The Fragmented Landscape of Global Governance**

There is a broad consensus among scientists, policymakers, and civil society that the current state of international law and governance is dangerously inadequate for managing the challenges posed by SAI.2  
Currently, no international treaty or body has been specifically created to govern SAI research or potential deployment. Existing international legal instruments are a poor and fragmented fit.6

* The **Environmental Modification Convention (ENMOD)** of 1977 prohibits the *military or any other hostile use* of large-scale environmental modification techniques. However, it explicitly allows for such techniques for *peaceful purposes*, leaving a significant gray area regarding the legality of a "peaceful" SAI deployment that could nonetheless cause transboundary harm.77  
* The **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)** has adopted decisions that amount to a de facto moratorium on geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity, urging parties not to allow such activities until a robust scientific basis exists to justify them and the associated risks have been considered.6 However, these decisions are not legally binding in the same way as a formal treaty protocol.  
* The **London Convention/London Protocol**, which governs dumping at sea, has established a restrictive framework for marine geoengineering but has no direct jurisdiction over atmospheric interventions like SAI.6

This profound governance gap creates immense risks, most notably the "free driver" problem of unilateral deployment, which could have destabilizing global consequences.53 There is an urgent and widely recognized need to begin international deliberations to develop a robust, transparent, and inclusive governance framework. Proposals range from establishing a World Commission on SRM under the United Nations to negotiating an international non-use agreement to prohibit deployment.80 Without such a framework, the world remains unprepared for the complex decisions that SAI research and development will inevitably force upon it.

## **Section 6: Synthesis and Forward-Looking Recommendations**

This final section synthesizes the report's findings, offering a holistic view of the Stratospheric Aerosol Injection dilemma. It provides a concluding analysis of the risk-benefit calculus and presents actionable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and the international community to navigate this complex and perilous frontier of climate science and policy.

### **6.1 Synthesizing the Risk-Benefit Calculus**

The analysis of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection presents a profound dilemma. On one hand, the technology offers the potential for a high-leverage, rapid, and relatively inexpensive intervention that could significantly reduce global temperatures and avert some of the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.1 Climate models, supported by the natural analogue of volcanic eruptions, show with a high degree of confidence that SAI  
*could* work from a purely physical standpoint, offering a powerful tool in a world where emissions reduction efforts are falling short of what is required.1  
On the other hand, SAI is fraught with profound, diverse, and deeply uncertain risks. It is a symptomatic treatment that fails to address the root cause of climate change—greenhouse gas concentrations—and therefore allows ocean acidification to continue unabated.45 Its deployment would have predictable and severe side effects, most notably the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer and the disruption of global precipitation patterns, threatening water and food security for billions.21 It introduces novel and potentially catastrophic risks, such as the "termination shock," which would create a dependence on the technology and hold future generations hostage to its continuous operation.17 Furthermore, it presents unprecedented geopolitical challenges, including the risk of unilateral deployment and international conflict.53  
The core conclusion of this analysis is that SAI is not a solution, but a trade-off. It proposes to exchange one set of familiar, albeit accelerating and severe, risks from climate change for a new set of unfamiliar, poorly understood, and potentially even more dangerous anthropogenic risks.17 The decision to pursue such a path cannot be based on technical feasibility alone but requires a comprehensive evaluation of a complex web of interconnected environmental, social, and political consequences.

### **6.2 Recommendations for Research Governance**

Given the high stakes and profound uncertainties, any further research into SAI must proceed under a robust, transparent, and internationally coordinated governance framework. The ad-hoc, self-governed approach that characterized early research is no longer tenable, as demonstrated by the SCoPEx case. The following principles should guide the development of such a framework:

1. **Establish International Oversight:** An independent, international body, potentially under the auspices of the United Nations, should be established to oversee and coordinate all proposed SAI research. This body should be globally representative, with strong participation from the Global South and Indigenous peoples.63  
2. **Mandate Transparency:** All research activities, including funding sources, methodologies, and results, must be fully transparent and publicly accessible. This is essential to build public trust and to counteract the spread of misinformation.9  
3. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessments:** Any proposal for outdoor experimentation, no matter how small, must be preceded by a comprehensive and independent assessment of potential risks. This assessment must extend beyond physical climate impacts to include ecological, social, economic, ethical, and geopolitical consequences.9  
4. **Ensure Inclusive Public Participation:** Mechanisms for meaningful and inclusive public deliberation and consultation must be a prerequisite for any research that moves beyond computer modeling. The principle of free, prior, and informed consent for Indigenous peoples whose territories may be affected must be respected.73

### **6.3 Policy Implications**

The existence of SAI as a potential, albeit risky, intervention has significant implications for broader climate policy.

1. **Prioritize Mitigation and Adaptation:** The primary and most urgent policy response to climate change must remain the rapid and aggressive reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the scaling up of adaptation efforts. Policymakers and the public must understand that SAI is not a substitute for mitigation; at best, it is a potential temporary supplement with severe side effects.14 The "moral hazard" of using SAI as an excuse to delay decarbonization is a significant political risk that must be actively countered.  
2. **Proactively Develop International Governance:** The international community should proactively engage in diplomatic forums to address the governance gap for SAI. This should include discussions on establishing clear rules for research and seriously considering an international non-use agreement or moratorium on deployment and large-scale experimentation until the risks, benefits, and governance challenges are far better understood.80  
3. **Invest in Monitoring and Risk Research:** Governments should make a "no-regrets" investment in enhancing stratospheric monitoring and observation capabilities. This is critical for improving climate models and for creating a system to detect and attribute any potential SAI activities, whether authorized or not.61 Furthermore, public funding should be directed toward independent research focused specifically on the risks, uncertainties, and potential negative impacts of SAI to ensure a balanced knowledge base that is not skewed by those focused solely on developing the technology.8
