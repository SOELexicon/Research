## Detailed Description
The 2024 Bilderberg Meeting in Madrid marked a critical escalation in AI surveillance technology militarization, featuring agenda items on "State of AI," "AI Safety," and "Future of Warfare" that explicitly linked artificial intelligence to military applications. The meeting demonstrated rapid progression from discussing AI ethics in 2019 to warfare applications by 2024, coordinating the militarization of surveillance technologies developed by corporate participants.

This meeting established the framework for military deployment of AI surveillance systems, coordinating technology transfer from corporate AI development to military and intelligence applications. The discussions preceded the widespread integration of AI surveillance technology into NATO defense systems and military population control mechanisms.
