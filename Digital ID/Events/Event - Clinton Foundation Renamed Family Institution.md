# Event: Clinton Foundation Renamed Family Institution

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Renaming of Clinton Foundation to "Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation"
- **When**: February 2013
- **Where**: [[Entity - United States]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Bill Clinton]], [[Entity - Hillary Clinton]], [[Entity - Chelsea Clinton]]
- **Why**: Reflect Hillary Clinton's return and Chelsea Clinton's expanded role

## Detailed Description
In February 2013, the William J. Clinton Foundation underwent a significant organizational transformation, renaming itself the "Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation." This rebranding represented more than a cosmetic change; it fundamentally altered the organization's identity from a post-presidential legacy project into an explicit family dynasty institution.

The renaming coincided with Hillary Clinton's departure from her role as Secretary of State and her joining the foundation's board of directors. This move signaled her return to the foundation's active leadership and set the stage for what many viewed as preparation for a potential 2016 presidential campaign. The inclusion of Chelsea Clinton's name formally recognized her growing influence within the organization and established her as the next generation of Clinton family leadership.

The transformation created unprecedented concentration of political, philanthropic, and family power within a single charitable organization. This consolidation would prove to be both a source of enhanced fundraising capacity and a structural vulnerability that generated increased scrutiny and criticism.
