# Event: China Social Credit System Concept Announcement 2013

## Quick Facts
- **What**: State Council releases the "Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System (2014-2020)", formalizing China's intent to build a nationwide social credit framework integrating government, financial, and social data.
- **When**: 14 June 2013 (document issued)
- **Where**: Beijing, China
- **Who**: State Council, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), People's Bank of China (PBoC)
- **Why**: Establish mechanisms to "promote trust in government, commerce, society, and judiciary" through unified credit information sharing, leading to behavioral control.

## Detailed Description
The 2013 Planning Outline laid the conceptual foundation for China's social credit system. It set goals for establishing national credit registries for individuals and enterprises, integrating data from courts, tax authorities, police, and financial institutions. The document introduced the idea of "joint rewards and punishments" (守信联合激励和失信联合惩戒) for trustworthy vs. untrustworthy actors, paving the way for blacklists and redlists.

Key directives included:
- Building a unified social credit information platform under NDRC leadership.
- Encouraging financial institutions to share credit data with the central bank.
- Creating pilot zones and sector-specific credit schemes (transport, commerce, tourism).
- Promoting public disclosure of credit information to "strengthen social supervision".

## Participants
- **State Council**: Highest administrative authority issuing policy outline.
- **NDRC**: Tasked with coordination of data-sharing platforms.
- **People's Bank of China**: Responsible for financial credit registries and licensing private credit scoring firms.
- **Ministry of Public Security**: Charged with integrating policing records.

## Timeline
- **2013-06-14**: Planning Outline released publicly.
- **2014**: Pilot cities selected (see [[Event - China Social Credit System Pilots]]).
- **2015-2016**: Expansion of sectoral credit blacklists (aviation, environmental compliance).
- **2018**: Full rollout (see [[Event - China Social Credit System National Rollout]]).

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Provided policy mandate for national social credit architecture.
- Authorized creation of corporate and individual credit codes.
- Led to licensing of private "market-based" scoring firms (e.g., Sesame Credit).
- Set performance metrics for government agencies to contribute data.

## Documentation & Evidence

## Significance
This announcement marks the conceptual launch of China's social credit journey, connecting subsequent pilot programs and national implementation.
