# Event - W3C VC Working Group Reconvened

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Reconvening of W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group for v2.0 development
- **When**: September 2022
- **Where**: Virtual meeting format
- **Who**: W3C members, digital identity industry stakeholders, standards contributors
- **Why**: Accelerate Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 standards development

## Detailed Description
The World Wide Web Consortium reconvened the Verifiable Credentials Working Group in September 2022 to accelerate development of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 specification, marking a critical acceleration phase in global digital identity standards development. This reconvening followed growing industry demand for enhanced verifiable credential capabilities and government adoption requirements.

The working group reconvening represented a significant escalation in standards development pace, driven by real-world implementation learnings from COVID-19 health pass systems, corporate digital identity platform requirements, and government digital ID deployment programs. The timing aligned with the World Economic Forum's Digital ID initiative and growing pressure for standardized decentralized identity infrastructure.
