# Event - GeoMIP International Modeling Coordination

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Launch of coordinated international climate modeling effort for geoengineering scenarios
- **When**: 2010 (formal initiative launch)
- **Where**: Global network of climate modeling centers
- **Who**: [[Entity - Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project]] coordinating international researchers
- **Significance**: Standardization of geoengineering research and international scientific legitimization

## Detailed Description
The 2010 launch of the [[Entity - Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project]] represented a critical milestone in the international legitimization and standardization of geoengineering research. GeoMIP established coordinated protocols for climate modeling centers worldwide to run standardized geoengineering scenarios, creating the first systematic global research infrastructure for evaluating planetary-scale atmospheric intervention. This international coordination effort transformed geoengineering from isolated academic research into a globally coordinated scientific enterprise, providing standardized data for policy development while normalizing the concept of deliberate planetary climate modification.

The project brought together the world's leading climate modeling centers to run identical intervention scenarios, enabling systematic comparison of model results and comprehensive assessment of intervention effects. By establishing common research protocols and data sharing standards, GeoMIP created the scientific foundation for evidence-based geoengineering policy while simultaneously legitimizing intervention research as normal scientific practice requiring international coordination rather than democratic deliberation.
