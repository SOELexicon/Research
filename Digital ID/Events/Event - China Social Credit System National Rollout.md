# Event: China Social Credit System National Rollout

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Nationwide enforcement of China's social credit system integrating citizen and corporate scoring, blacklists, and data sharing across ministries
- **When**: 2018 (national policy enforcement escalated January–December)
- **Where**: People's Republic of China (all provinces and major municipalities)
- **Who**: Beijing leadership, State Council, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Supreme People's Court, Ministry of Transport, Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), and commercial partners
- **Why**: Expand pilot programs into a unified national surveillance infrastructure regulating access to transportation, finance, education, and social services

## Detailed Description
After four years of municipal pilots, the Chinese State Council and NDRC declared the social credit system infrastructure ready for national deployment in 2018. Key measures included the expansion of unified blacklists and redlists, integration of court judgments with financial and travel records, and mandatory data sharing between ministries. Citizens deemed "untrustworthy" faced restrictions on air/rail travel, high-speed train use, hotel stays, and luxury consumption, while corporations risked credit downgrades, procurement bans, and higher regulatory scrutiny.

The Supreme People's Court published defaulter lists to shame debtors, resulting in 17.5 million blocked airline ticket purchases and 5.5 million train denials by 2019. The Ministry of Transport and CAAC enforced real-time checks on booking systems. Financial institutions integrated social credit ratings into loan eligibility, expanding state control over economic participation.

## Participants
### Central Government Bodies
- **State Council**: Oversees implementation under the Social Credit System Construction Plan (2014-2020)
- **National Development and Reform Commission**: Coordinates inter-ministerial data exchange
- **People's Bank of China**: Supplies financial credit data and scoring frameworks
- **Supreme People's Court**: Maintains defaulter blacklist (失信被执行人名单)
- **Ministry of Public Security**: Provides policing data, ID verification, and surveillance feeds

### Sectoral Regulators
- **Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)**: Enforces flight bans for low scores
- **Ministry of Transport**: Controls high-speed rail and public transit access
- **Ministry of Education**: Restricts university admissions for blacklisted families
- **State Administration for Market Regulation**: Manages corporate credit registry

### Corporate Participants
- [[Alibaba Group]] (Sesame Credit) and [[Tencent]] supply data analytics and scoring algorithms
- UnionPay, Ping An, and other financial institutions integrate scoring for risk assessment
- Technology vendors build data lakes, facial recognition, and real-time analytics

## Timeline
- **2018-01**: State Council issues directives for nationwide data sharing and joint punishment mechanisms
- **2018-05**: Supreme People's Court and CAAC announce coordinated travel bans
- **2018-09**: NDRC publishes "Notice on Comprehensive Implementation of the Joint Punishment System"
- **2018-11**: CAAC reports 17.5 million flight purchase denials due to social credit blacklists
- **2019-01**: System expands to cross-border travel restrictions and visa controls

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Institutionalized "joint rewards and punishments" across 40 state agencies
- Implemented real-time travel restrictions affecting millions of citizens
- Mandated corporate compliance with centralized credit files and risk scores
- Established permanent integration of social credit with law enforcement, finance, and civic participation

## Documentation & Evidence
- State Council directives and NDRC implementation guidelines (2018)
- Supreme People's Court statistical bulletins (失信被执行人名单数据)
- CAAC and Ministry of Transport enforcement reports
- Congressional Research Service IF11342: "China's Social Credit System"
- Academic research by Genia Kostka (2018) and Samantha Hoffman (ASPI 2019)

## Significance
The national rollout transformed the social credit system from localized experiments into a comprehensive nationwide control mechanism. It demonstrated the CCP's ability to integrate financial, legal, and surveillance data to regulate citizen behavior, serving as a model for digital authoritarianism. Documented enforcement metrics provide verifiable evidence of mass behavior modification via access restrictions.
