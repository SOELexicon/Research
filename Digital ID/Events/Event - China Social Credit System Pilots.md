# Event: China Social Credit System Pilots

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Launch of municipal pilot projects for China's social credit system
- **When**: 2014 (multiple pilots authorized January–June)
- **Where**: Cities including Hangzhou, Suzhou, Chongqing, Shanghai Free Trade Zone, Rongcheng, and Shenzhen
- **Who**: Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), People's Bank of China (PBoC), local municipal governments
- **Why**: Test unified data-sharing frameworks, behavioral scoring algorithms, and enforcement mechanisms prior to nationwide rollout

## Detailed Description
The State Council authorized the first wave of social credit pilots in 2014, designating Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and other municipalities to integrate financial records, administrative penalties, and public security data into centralized behavioral scoring systems. The People's Bank of China simultaneously licensed eight private firms—Tencent, Alibaba's Ant Financial, Ping An, UnionPay, Sina Finance, CRIF, and others—to develop competing credit scoring algorithms that would feed into a central "trustworthiness" database managed by the government. Pilots tested reward and punishment mechanisms such as public blacklists, travel restrictions, preferential loan access, and social service prioritization.

## Participants
### Central Authorities
- **State Council**: Issued 2014 "Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System"
- **National Development and Reform Commission**: Coordinated municipal pilot design
- **People's Bank of China**: Oversaw financial credit pilot and private scoring experiments
- **Ministry of Public Security**: Provided policing and surveillance data integrations

### Corporate Partners
- [[Tencent Holdings]] and [[Alibaba Group]] (Ant Financial/Alipay) – digital payment data and credit scoring
- Ping An Insurance – Integrated financial/insurance analytics
- China UnionPay and China Chengxin – Financial credit infrastructure
- Local technology vendors providing data warehousing and analytics

### Municipal Governments
- Hangzhou – Implemented "City Brain" analytics for citizen scoring
- Rongcheng – Developed points-based citizen ranking (AAA to D) with public notice boards
- Suzhou and Wenzhou – Launched "Credit Suzhou" and "Credit Wenzhou" portals displaying citizen/company scores

## Timeline
- **2014-01**: State Council publishes Social Credit System Planning Outline (2014-2020)
- **2014-03**: PBoC licenses eight private firms for pilot credit scoring
- **2014-06**: Municipal pilot list finalized; local governments begin data integration
- **2014-10**: Rongcheng issues first social credit regulations and ranking system
- **2015-01**: Pilots expand to additional cities (Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou)

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Established technical architecture for national data-sharing across agencies
- Validated use of blacklists/redlists for behavioral control (e.g., travel bans, loan restrictions)
- Created standardized citizen/company scoring models later used nationwide
- Enabled integration of surveillance data with financial and legal records

## Documentation & Evidence
- 2014 State Council Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System (2014-2020)
- NDRC pilot reports and municipal implementation regulations (Hangzhou, Suzhou, Rongcheng)
- People's Bank of China announcements on private scoring licenses
- Academic analyses: Rogier Creemers (Oxford), Samantha Hoffman (ASPI), Genia Kostka (Free University Berlin)
- Congressional Research Service report IF11342 (2021) detailing pilot evolution

## Significance
The 2014 pilots mark the operational beginning of China's social credit system, demonstrating government intentions to merge data across sectors to regulate behavior. These pilots provided the blueprint for the 2018 national rollout, showcasing how local experiments can establish surveillance infrastructure later scaled nationwide. They also illustrated public-private collaboration between technology giants and the state to enforce compliance.
