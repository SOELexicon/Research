# Event - 2003-03-20 Iraq War Launch Based on False WMD Intelligence

## Quick Facts
- **What**: UK and US launch invasion of Iraq based on false claims about weapons of mass destruction
- **When**: March 20, 2003
- **Where**: [[Entity - Iraq]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Tony Blair]], [[Entity - George W. Bush]], UK and US military forces
- **Why**: Claimed threat from Iraqi WMDs that did not exist, defining Blair's legacy destruction

## Detailed Description
The March 20, 2003 invasion of Iraq represents the defining catastrophe of Tony Blair's premiership and modern British foreign policy. Despite the largest protest march in British history and a massive parliamentary rebellion with 139 Labour MPs voting against the government, Blair committed UK forces to a US-led invasion based on intelligence claims that proved to be completely false. The decision would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, regional destabilization, and the permanent destruction of Blair's political legacy and moral authority.

## Legal and Political Context

### Parliamentary Process
- **Parliamentary Rebellion**: 139 Labour MPs voted against government's war motion - largest rebellion in modern British history
- **No UN Authorization**: Proceeded without second explicit UN Security Council resolution authorizing force
- **Legal Controversy**: Government's legal justification questioned by international law experts
- **Public Opposition**: Largest protest march in British history with millions opposing the war

### Intelligence Claims
- **45-Minute Claim**: Government dossier claimed Iraq could deploy chemical/biological weapons within 45 minutes
- **WMD Threat**: Blair argued Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction posing imminent threat
- **Al-Qaeda Links**: False claims about connections between Iraqi regime and international terrorism
- **Dodgy Dossier**: Intelligence compilation later revealed to contain plagiarized and unreliable information

## Official Investigations and Findings

- Blair-Bush relationship was "determining factor" in UK participation decision
- Post-war planning was "wholly inadequate" for complex challenges

### Butler Review (2004)
**Intelligence Assessment:**
- Pre-war intelligence was "seriously flawed"
- 45-minute claim was based on single, unreliable source
- Intelligence community groupthink contributed to failures
- No deliberate attempt to mislead but "more weight placed on intelligence than it could bear"

### Hutton Inquiry (2004)

- Government weapons expert who questioned WMD claims
- Found dead after being exposed as BBC source criticizing intelligence
- Inquiry cleared government but created lasting suspicion about official pressure
