# Event: EU eIDAS 2.0 Regulation Entry into Force

## Quick Facts
- **What**: EU's eIDAS 2.0 regulation establishing comprehensive digital identity framework
- **When**: May 20, 2024
- **Where**: [[European Union]] (all 27 member states)

- **Why**: Mandatory digital wallet implementation with 80% adoption target by 2030

## Detailed Description
The European Union's eIDAS 2.0 regulation entered force on May 20, 2024, establishing the most comprehensive digital identity framework globally. The regulation requires all 27 member states to provide digital wallets to citizens by December 2026, with an ambitious 80% adoption target by 2030. The most controversial element, Article 45a, creates unprecedented browser security risks by requiring all web browsers to recognize government-approved Qualified Website Authentication Certificates (QWACs) without applying additional security requirements.

## Participants
### Regulatory Authorities
- [[European Commission]] - Primary regulatory author and enforcer

- 10+ major technology organizations - Coalition opposing Article 45a
- Browser manufacturers - Required to implement government-approved certificates

### Implementation Leaders
- Germany - Over 5 million BundID users by 2024
- France - France Identit√© received high assurance certification September 2024

## Timeline
