# Event: Bilderberg 2025 Meeting Stockholm

## Quick Facts
- **What**: 71st Bilderberg Meeting coordinating global digital control infrastructure
- **When**: June 12-15, 2025
- **Where**: Stockholm Grand Hôtel, [[Entity - Sweden]]
- **Who**: 121 participants from 23 countries including technology architects and government implementers
- **Why**: Coordinate digital ID, AI surveillance, and population control technology deployment

## Detailed Description
The 71st Bilderberg Meeting marked an unprecedented convergence of digital infrastructure architects and government implementation partners to coordinate global population control mechanisms. For the first time in recent Bilderberg history, the official agenda explicitly included "Depopulation and Migration" alongside "AI, Deterrence and National Security," signaling coordinated planning around demographic management systems integrated with surveillance technology.

The meeting assembled an extraordinary concentration of digital control infrastructure architects including Microsoft CEO [[Entity - Satya Nadella]], former Google CEO [[Entity - Eric Schmidt]], Palantir leaders [[Entity - Alex Karp]] and [[Entity - Peter Thiel]], Google DeepMind's [[Entity - Demis Hassabis]], and Microsoft AI chief [[Entity - Mustafa Suleyman]]. These technology architects coordinated directly with implementation partners including NATO Secretary General [[Entity - Mark Rutte]], Swedish Prime Minister [[Entity - Ulf Kristersson]], and UK Health Secretary [[Entity - Wes Streeting]].
