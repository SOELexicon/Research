Mark Sexton announced via Facebook:
> "The Court of Appeal dismissed our application and appeal on the 19th of March 2024. Exhausting all domestic procedures is a requirement for any application to the ICC (International Criminal Court). We will inform you if there are any other developments."

## Legal Significance

### Exhaustion of Domestic Remedies
**International Law Requirement:**
- Rome Statute of ICC requires exhaustion of domestic remedies before ICC jurisdiction
- Article 17 (complementarity principle): ICC only acts when national courts unwilling or unable
- Sexton's legal team explicitly planned for this requirement

**Pathway to ICC:**
- All UK domestic legal channels exhausted:
  - Criminal complaint (Metropolitan Police)
  - Judicial review (High Court)
  - Appeal (Court of Appeal)
- Met admissibility requirements for ICC application
- Demonstrates UK unwillingness to investigate allegations

### Implications of Systematic Rejection

**Pattern of Institutional Protection:**
1. **Metropolitan Police** - Refused to investigate, closed case
2. **High Court** - Refused to review police closure
3. **Court of Appeal** - Refused to overturn High Court decision

**Interpretation:**
- Three-tier institutional rejection
- UK legal system protecting government from accountability
- Systematic denial of justice domestically
- Justifies international intervention (ICC)

## Crime Reference Number 6029679/21 Background

### Original Allegations
- Serious misconduct in public office
- Related to UK Government COVID-19 response
- Filed by Mark Sexton alongside legal and medical professionals
- Evidence of:
  - Unlawful lockdowns
  - Vaccine harms and deaths
  - Elderly care home deaths
  - Suppression of treatments
  - Informed consent violations

### Police Closure Rationale
- Closed February 2022 (approximately 2 months after filing)
- No apparent full investigation conducted
- Closure deemed unlawful by complainants
- Prompted judicial review application

## Legal Team Coordination

### Mark Sexton's Role

- Coordinated with lawyers and medical professionals
- Managed public communications via social media

### Legal Team Structure
- Lawyers specializing in public law

## Strategic Legal Planning

### ICC Application Preparation
Explicitly stated goal:
> "Exhausting all domestic procedures is a requirement for any application to the ICC (International Criminal Court)"

**Implications:**
- Legal team planned ICC application from beginning
- Anticipated UK courts would reject
- Systematic documentation of institutional failure
- Building case for international jurisdiction

### Evidence Preservation
- Documented Met Police refusal to investigate
- Documented High Court refusal to review
- Documented Court of Appeal refusal to appeal
- Created evidence trail of domestic remedy exhaustion

## International Criminal Court Context

### ICC Jurisdiction
**Crimes Within ICC Jurisdiction:**
- Genocide (Article 6)
- Crimes against humanity (Article 7)
- War crimes (Article 8)
- Crime of aggression (Article 8 bis)

**Potential Applicable Charges:**
- **Crimes against humanity** - Article 7(1)(k): "Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering"
- **Murder** - Article 7(1)(a): "Murder" as crime against humanity when widespread or systematic
- **Persecution** - Article 7(1)(h): Persecution against identifiable group

### ICC Admissibility Requirements (Article 17)

**Complementarity Principle:**
ICC only acts when national courts:
1. Are unwilling to genuinely investigate or prosecute, OR
2. Are unable to investigate or prosecute

**Mark Sexton Case Evidence:**
- ✅ Case brought to national authorities (Met Police)

- ✅ Judicial review sought (High Court)
- ✅ Judicial review denied
- ✅ Appeal sought (Court of Appeal)

- ✅ All domestic remedies exhausted

**Demonstrates UK "unwillingness"** to investigate alleged crimes against humanity

### ICC Application Process

**Next Steps:**
1. Prepare Article 15 communication to ICC Prosecutor
2. Submit evidence of alleged crimes
3. Submit evidence of domestic remedy exhaustion
4. Request preliminary examination
5. ICC Prosecutor assesses gravity, jurisdiction, admissibility
6. Potential formal investigation authorization
