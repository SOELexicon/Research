# Event - NPCC Operation Talla Publication Strategy Creation

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Creation of Operation Talla Publication Strategy establishing centralized information control
- **When**: March 9, 2020
- **Where**: [[Entity - National Police Chiefs' Council]], [[Entity - United Kingdom]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Sherry Traquair]], [[Entity - Fi Greenlees]] (authors), [[Entity - Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt]] (authorization)
- **Why**: Establish coordinated information management framework for COVID-19 policing response

## Detailed Description
The NPCC Operation Talla Publication Strategy was created as a comprehensive framework for managing information disclosure and transparency during the UK's COVID-19 policing response. The document established unprecedented centralized control over Freedom of Information requests, systematic publication delays, and coordinated "sterile periods" before public disclosure.

The strategy represented a fundamental shift from distributed police force information management to centralized national coordination, requiring all Operation Talla-related FOI requests to be referred to NPCC for a "national corporate view."

## Key Participants

### Document Authors
- **[[Entity - Sherry Traquair]]** - NPCC Communications/Information Management
- **[[Entity - Fi Greenlees]]** - NPCC Communications/Information Management

### Authorization Authority
- **[[Entity - Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt]]** - NPCC Chair
  - Role: Final authorization of publication strategy
  - Authority: Coordination of all Home Office police forces
  - Responsibility: Strategic oversight of Operation Talla

## Key Components Established

### Centralized Information Control
- **FOI Centralization**: Mandatory referral of all Operation Talla FOI requests to NPCC
- **"National Corporate View"**: Coordinated response across all 43 Chief Constables
- **Cross-Force Coordination**: Elimination of independent force responses
- **Strategic Alignment**: Protection of undisclosed "strategic aims"

### Publication Delay Mechanisms
- **Section 22 Exemption**: Legal framework for deferring FOI responses
- **Timeline**: Most data withheld until July 2022 (2+ years after implementation)
- **Justification**: Prevention of "random piecemeal disclosures" damaging strategic objectives
- **Scope**: Comprehensive delay covering operational and strategic information

### "Sterile Period" Framework
- **Definition**: Period before public disclosure allowing stakeholder coordination
- **Purpose**: Prevent "harm from random incomplete information entering public domain"
- **Participants**: Cross-agency coordination including Home Office, Cabinet Office
- **Duration**: Unspecified coordination period before any public release

## Strategic Objectives

### Stated Purposes
- Coordination of information disclosure across police forces
- Prevention of contradictory or incomplete public information
- Protection of operational security and strategic planning
- Maintenance of public confidence in policing response

### Undisclosed "Strategic Aims"
- Document references protection of unspecified "strategic aims"
- Concern about "damage" from transparency to strategic objectives
- Coordination with cross-government stakeholders
- Preparation for extended operational timeline

## Implementation Impact

### Transparency Restrictions
- Multi-year delays in public access to operational information
- Centralized control bypassing local democratic oversight
- Systematic use of legal exemptions to defer disclosure
- Protection of strategic planning from public scrutiny

### Cross-Agency Coordination
- Integration with Home Office policy coordination
- Alignment with Cabinet Office cross-government strategy
- Coordination with health authorities and regulatory bodies
- Establishment of permanent coordination infrastructure

### Democratic Accountability
- Reduction in local force independence
- Centralization of information management
- Bypass of normal transparency mechanisms
- Protection from external accountability oversight

## Intelligence Assessment

### Significance
This event represents the creation of the foundational information control architecture that enabled systematic suppression of accountability efforts and transparency during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategy established precedents for centralized information management that extended far beyond normal policing operations.

### Strategic Implications
- **Information Environment Control**: Systematic management of public information during crisis
- **Democratic Oversight Bypass**: Centralized coordination outside local accountability
- **Permanent Infrastructure**: Framework for future crisis information management
- **Cross-Agency Integration**: Model for government-wide information coordination

### Validation of Allegations
The publication strategy validates key allegations made by accountability campaigners:
- **[[Entity - Mark Sexton]]**: Information suppression directives confirmed
- **[[Entity - Ethical Approach UK]]**: Centralized control mechanisms documented
- **Accountability Resistance**: Systematic framework for managing external oversight
