# Event: DOGE Accenture Contract Cancellation $1.4 Billion

## Quick Facts
- **What**: The U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminates $1.4 billion in Accenture federal IT and consulting contracts, triggering review of government digital identity and data integration projects
- **When**: September 2024 (announcement on 15 September 2024)
- **Where**: United States federal agencies; primary impacts in Washington, D.C. and Department of Defense (DoD) programs
- **Who**: DOGE, Accenture Federal Services, DoD, General Services Administration (GSA), Palantir Technologies (downstream partner)
- **Why**: Cost overruns, performance issues, and strategic shift toward alternative vendors following high-profile security failures and vendor lock-in concerns

## Detailed Description
The newly established DOGE reviewed legacy consulting and integration contracts to curb waste and improve accountability across federal agencies. In September 2024, DOGE cancelled $1.4 billion worth of Accenture Federal Services agreements covering digital transformation, identity management, and analytics platforms. Key programs included Department of Energy modernization, defense logistics data integration, and public service digital identity initiatives.

The cancellation followed multiple cybersecurity incidents and the high-profile Microsoft OneGov contract controversy, prompting DOGE to reassess reliance on large integrators. Accenture faced criticism for vendor lock-in architectures that limited agency flexibility and created cost escalation. Following cancellation, Accenture announced a strategic partnership with [[Entity - Palantir Technologies]] to retain government business via AI and data analytics offerings, training 1,000 federal professionals on Palantir Foundry and AIP solutions.

## Participants
### Government Agencies
- **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)**: Oversight body conducting contract reviews
- **General Services Administration (GSA)**: Administers federal procurement schedules affected by cancellation
- **Department of Defense**: Major beneficiary of reallocated funds; evaluated alternative integration strategies
- **Department of Energy** and other civilian agencies impacted by project halts

### Corporate Stakeholders
- **Accenture Federal Services**: Prime contractor losing $1.4 billion in task orders
- **Palantir Technologies**: Partnered with Accenture post-cancellation to retain market share
- **[[Entity - Microsoft Corporation]]** and **[[Entity - Amazon Web Services]]**: Benefited from reevaluation of cloud and identity contracts under DOGE review

### Oversight & Legislative Actors

- **2024-12**: Ongoing procurement reforms and pilot programs with alternative vendors (including open-source options)

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Immediate suspension of Accenture-led modernization projects; agencies seek replacement vendors
- Increased scrutiny of vendor lock-in practices, aligning with [[Finding - Corporate Vendor Lock-in Architecture 2024-2025]]
- Shift toward smaller, modular contracts and open architectures for digital identity and analytics systems
- Strengthened case for independent security assessments following Microsoft OneGov and National Public Data breaches

- Accenture and Palantir joint press statements announcing partnership pivot (October 2024)

## Significance

The cancellation also catalyzed new alliances between major contractors and data platforms like Palantir, reinforcing concerns highlighted in investigations about consolidation of control over digital identity infrastructure.
