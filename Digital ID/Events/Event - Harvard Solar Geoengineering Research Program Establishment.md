# Event - Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program Establishment

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Establishment of major interdisciplinary geoengineering research program with outdoor experiment plans
- **When**: 2015 (formal program establishment)
- **Where**: Harvard University, [[Entity - United States]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program]], leading climate researchers
- **Significance**: First major academic program explicitly planning outdoor geoengineering experiments

## Detailed Description
The 2015 establishment of the [[Entity - Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program]] represented the most significant institutionalization of geoengineering research to date, creating the first major academic program explicitly dedicated to developing and testing planetary-scale atmospheric intervention technologies. The program brought together leading researchers across disciplines to advance solar radiation management research from computer modeling toward real-world experimentation, including plans for outdoor stratospheric experiments that would eventually trigger the first major governance crisis in geoengineering research.

The program's establishment marked a critical escalation in geoengineering research, moving beyond theoretical modeling to active development of deployment technologies and outdoor testing capabilities. With substantial funding and prestigious academic backing, the program positioned Harvard as the global leader in intervention research while creating the institutional foundation for transitioning from research to potential deployment of planetary atmospheric modification technologies.
