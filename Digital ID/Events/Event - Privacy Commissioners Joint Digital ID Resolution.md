# Event: Privacy Commissioners Joint Digital ID Resolution

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Joint resolution by federal, provincial, and territorial privacy commissioners on digital ID
- **When**: September 21, 2022
- **Where**: [[Entity - Canada]]
- **Who**: All Canadian privacy commissioners at federal, provincial, and territorial levels
- **Why**: Establishing privacy-protective framework for digital identity ecosystem development

## Detailed Description
Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial privacy commissioners issued a comprehensive joint resolution titled "Ensuring the Right to Privacy and Transparency in the Digital Identity Ecosystem in Canada." The resolution represents the most authoritative statement on privacy requirements for digital identity systems in Canada, providing a framework to guide government implementation while protecting civil liberties.

The resolution emerged as privacy commissioners observed the fragmented development of provincial digital identity systems and sought to establish common privacy principles before widespread implementation. The timing preceded major provincial launches like [[Event - Alberta Wallet Digital Identity Launch]] and provided framework guidance for existing systems like [[Event - BC Services Card Digital ID Implementation]].

## Participants
### Privacy Commissioners
- [[Entity - Privacy Commissioner of Canada]] - Federal privacy oversight
- [[Entity - Provincial Privacy Commissioners]] - All provincial privacy authorities
- [[Entity - Territorial Privacy Commissioners]] - Territorial privacy oversight bodies

### Stakeholder Context
- Federal and provincial governments developing digital ID systems
- Technology vendors implementing digital identity solutions
- Civil liberties organizations advocating for privacy protection
- Canadian citizens as intended beneficiaries of privacy protections

## Timeline
- **2018-2022**: Accelerating provincial digital ID implementations
- **2022**: Growing concerns about privacy and surveillance risks

- **2022-2025**: Resolution principles cited in ongoing digital ID debates
- **2024-2025**: Framework referenced during federal leadership crisis and election

## Outcomes & Decisions
### Core Privacy Principles Established
- **Voluntary Participation**: Digital ID use must be optional with accessible non-digital alternatives
- **User Control and Consent**: Individuals must control personal information and provide informed consent
- **Data Minimization**: Systems must collect only minimum necessary information per transaction
- **No Central Database**: Architecture should avoid central government data aggregation
- **Transparency and Oversight**: Clear accountability mechanisms and independent oversight required

### Policy Impact
- Framework for evaluating provincial implementations
- Benchmark for privacy-protective digital ID design
- Reference point for civil liberties advocacy
- Standard for federal policy development

## Documentation & Evidence
- [[Research - Canada's Population, Government, Digital ID]] - Analysis incorporating resolution principles
- Official joint resolution document: "Ensuring the Right to Privacy and Transparency in the Digital Identity Ecosystem in Canada"
- Privacy Commissioner statements and explanatory materials
- Subsequent policy references and citations

## Significance
The joint resolution represents the most comprehensive and authoritative statement on digital identity privacy requirements in Canada. It provides a potential compromise framework that could realize digital ID benefits while mitigating civil liberties risks, addressing concerns raised by organizations like the [[Entity - Canadian Civil Liberties Association]].

The resolution's emphasis on voluntary participation, data minimization, and decentralized architecture directly challenges more invasive digital ID models while providing a roadmap for privacy-protective implementation. The document serves as a benchmark against which current and future digital ID systems can be evaluated.

## Key Privacy Requirements
### Mandatory Principles
1. **Voluntary Participation**: No coercion or de facto mandatory use
2. **Alternative Access**: Reasonably convenient non-digital options always available
3. **Informed Consent**: Clear understanding of data collection and use
4. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary information collected per transaction
5. **User Control**: Individual authority over personal information sharing

### Architectural Requirements
- **Decentralized Design**: Avoid central government databases
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy protection embedded from system inception
- **Transparency**: Clear information about system operation and data use
- **Independent Oversight**: External monitoring and accountability mechanisms
- **Security**: Robust protection against unauthorized access and breaches
