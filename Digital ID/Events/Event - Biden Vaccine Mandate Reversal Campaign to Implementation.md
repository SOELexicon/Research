# Event - Biden Vaccine Mandate Reversal Campaign to Implementation

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Complete reversal of campaign position on federal vaccine mandate authority
- **When**: October 2020 (denial) to September 2021 (implementation)
- **Where**: [[Entity - United States]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Joe Biden]], [[Entity - Biden Administration]]

## Detailed Description
President [[Entity - Joe Biden]] implemented comprehensive federal vaccine mandates in September 2021, directly contradicting multiple explicit campaign statements in 2020 where he categorically denied federal authority to mandate vaccinations for the American people. This represents one of the most documented cases of systematic policy reversal in modern American politics, affecting over 100 million Americans through federal employee, contractor, healthcare worker, and large employer mandates.

The reversal demonstrates a pattern of campaign promises designed to gain political support while planning contradictory policies for implementation once in office. The scale and scope of the mandate system implemented far exceeded what was publicly discussed during the campaign period.
