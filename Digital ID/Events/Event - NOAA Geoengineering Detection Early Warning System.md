# Event - NOAA Geoengineering Detection Early Warning System

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Development of monitoring systems for detecting unauthorized atmospheric intervention operations
- **When**: June 2024 (initial operational capability)
- **Where**: [[Entity - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[Entity - United States]]
- **Who**: NOAA research scientists, government monitoring agencies, international partners
- **Significance**: First systematic capability for detecting unauthorized planetary atmospheric modification

## Detailed Description
The June 2024 development of NOAA's Geoengineering Detection Early Warning System represents the first systematic government response to the threat of unauthorized atmospheric intervention, creating monitoring capabilities designed to detect and track unilateral deployment of stratospheric aerosol injection and other climate modification technologies. The system development followed the emergence of unauthorized commercial geoengineering operations by [[Entity - Make Sunsets]] and growing recognition that the absence of monitoring capabilities creates conditions for undetected planetary-scale atmospheric manipulation.

The system combines satellite-based atmospheric monitoring, ground-based sensor networks, and advanced data analysis to detect chemical signatures, aerosol distributions, and atmospheric changes consistent with deliberate climate intervention. By establishing detection capabilities, NOAA acknowledged the reality of unauthorized intervention threats while creating infrastructure for potential regulation and response to unilateral atmospheric modification operations.
