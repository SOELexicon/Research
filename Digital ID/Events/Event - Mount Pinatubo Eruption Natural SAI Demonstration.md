# Event - Mount Pinatubo Eruption Natural SAI Demonstration

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Massive volcanic eruption injecting 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into stratosphere
- **When**: June 15, 1991 at 13:42 local time (PHT)
- **Where**: Mount Pinatubo, [[Entity - Philippines]]
- **Scale**: VEI-6 eruption, second-largest of 20th century
- **Global Impact**: 0.5°C global cooling for 2-3 years

## Detailed Description
Mount Pinatubo's catastrophic eruption provided an unprecedented natural demonstration of stratospheric aerosol injection effects on global climate. The volcanic explosion launched approximately 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, creating a global sulfate aerosol layer that reduced incoming solar radiation and caused measurable global cooling. This natural experiment became the foundational reference point for modern Stratospheric Aerosol Injection geoengineering research, demonstrating both the cooling potential and the complex side effects of atmospheric sulfur injection.

The eruption occurred after months of increasing volcanic activity, with the climactic phase beginning at 13:42 local time and continuing for approximately 9 hours. The volcanic column reached heights of 35 kilometers, well into the stratosphere, distributing sulfur compounds globally through atmospheric circulation. The resulting aerosol cloud persisted for 2-3 years, providing researchers with real-world data on stratospheric aerosol behavior, atmospheric chemistry effects, and global climate response.
