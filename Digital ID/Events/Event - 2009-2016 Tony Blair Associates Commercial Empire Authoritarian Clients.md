## Detailed Description
The Tony Blair Associates (TBA) period represents the most intensive phase of Blair's post-premiership commercialization, during which he built a vast, opaque network of consultancy relationships with some of the world's most controversial leaders and corporations. Operating simultaneously with his unpaid role as Middle East peace envoy, Blair advised dictators on image management, brokered multi-billion dollar deals for commissions, and established the template for post-democratic office monetization that would later evolve into the Oracle-funded Tony Blair Institute.
