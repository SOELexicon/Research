# Event - Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry Systematic Care Failure Testimonies

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Official inquiry documenting systematic failures in elderly care during COVID-19 lockdowns
- **When**: October 2023 - May 13, 2024
- **Where**: [[Entity - Scotland]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry]], families, care professionals, [[Entity - Shelagh McCall]] KC
- **Why**: Investigate care home failures and lockdown impacts on vulnerable populations

## Detailed Description
The Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry conducted hearings from October 2023 through May 2024, documenting what [[Entity - Shelagh McCall]] KC described as systematic failures affecting vulnerable elderly populations during COVID-19 lockdowns. The inquiry was described as "the world's only official COVID-19 inquiry to reveal the truth about what happened during lockdown hearing from families first hand."

The testimonies revealed systematic patterns of neglect, dehydration, starvation, and alleged forged Do Not Resuscitate orders, leading to what multiple observers characterized as institutional killing rather than virus-related deaths.

## Systematic Failures Documented

### Primary Evidence Categories
According to [[Entity - Shelagh McCall]] KC testimony:
> "Many families witnessed remotely a significant deterioration of their loved ones physical and mental health in lockdown that was NOTHING to do with COVID-19. Some suspect that their loved one was suffering from NEGLECT, DEHYDRATION and STARVATION."

### Documented Harms
1. **Lockdown/Isolation** - Forced separation from families removing oversight
2. **Medical Neglect** - Denial of proper medical care and attention
3. **Physical Deterioration** - Significant decline in physical health
4. **Mental Deterioration** - Severe decline in mental health and cognitive function
5. **Starvation** - Suspected deliberate denial of adequate nutrition
6. **Dehydration** - Suspected deliberate denial of adequate fluids
7. **Forged DNR Orders** - Do Not Resuscitate orders allegedly forged without consent
8. **Human Rights Violations** - Systematic violations of basic rights and dignity
9. **Power of Attorney Ignored** - Family legal authority systematically disregarded
10. **Missing Medical Records** - Documentation allegedly disappeared or destroyed

### Institutional Pattern Analysis
**Mechanism of Death (From Testimony Analysis):**
1. Elderly isolated from family oversight and advocacy
2. Neglect and poor care cause distress and anxiety
3. Distress managed with end-of-life sedation rather than proper care
4. Sedation combined with food/water deprivation leads to death
5. Deaths certified as "COVID-19" despite non-viral causation

## Public and Professional Response

### Citizen Response
**Amat (commenter):**
> "That was hard to watch, animals have more protection than what was given to the vulnerable elderly or people who had comprised health either mental or physical. The shocking thing in all of these people's testimonies is that it is obvious the system killed their relatives not the virus. They isolated them, denied relatives contact and when distress and anxiety set in because of neglect they quietened them down with end of life sedation. It is like listening to testimony coming out of Germany in the 1930s, utterly shocking and shameful."

**Martin Neil:**
> "Great compilation. I have no idea why this continues to be ignored by those who claim to be on our side. It is as if they want to deny the scale of iatrogenic harms in order to exaggerate the dangers from the virus."

### Mark Sexton Response (May 13, 2024)
> "If anyone out there still has any doubts about the mass murder of our beautiful elderly at the hands of doctors, nurses and carers all driven by government policy then look no further. 15 minutes of heartbreaking testimony evidenced at the Scottish Covid Inquiry. Thank you to Murray Ofthefamily Phillips for sending me this. I'm not ashamed to say my eyes filled up more than once watching this. Accountability MUST happen one way or another. God bless to all of the deceased and to their heartbroken loved ones who had to endure this nightmare."

## Media Coverage Analysis

### Mainstream Media Response
- **Coverage**: Poor coverage or ignored altogether
- **Analysis**: Systematic avoidance of inquiry findings
- **Pattern**: Consistent with broader accountability suppression

### Alternative Media Response
- **Coverage**: Largely ignored by "so-called alternative media"
- **Exception**: TNT Radio showing interest and covering testimonies
- **Analysis**: Suggests coordinated suppression across media spectrum

### Political Response
- **MSPs (Members of Scottish Parliament)**: Remained silent
- **MPs**: Generally silent except individual support
- **Analysis**: Political unwillingness to engage with evidence

### Independent Coverage
- **[[Entity - biologyphenom]] (Substack)**: Months of compilation work
- **[[Entity - @TheRustler83]] (X/Twitter)**: Individual documentation efforts
- **[[Entity - Freedom Podcast]]**: Independent Scottish coverage
- **Characterization**: Citizen journalism filling institutional media gap

## Historical Context and Parallels

### Historical Parallels Identified
Multiple commenters and observers drew parallels to:
- **Nazi Germany T4 Euthanasia Program (1939-1945)**
  - 70,000-275,000 disabled/elderly killed
  - Medical facilities used for systematic killing
  - Forged death certificates and documentation
  - Families denied access and oversight
  - "Mercy killing" and "life unworthy of life" justifications

### Government Policy Implications
- **Systematic Implementation**: Pattern across multiple care facilities
- **Policy-Driven**: Driven by government directives rather than individual malpractice
- **Legal Protection**: Protected by official COVID-19 emergency policies
- **Family Exclusion**: Deliberate prevention of family intervention and witnessing

## Intelligence Assessment

### Confirmed Systematic Patterns
- **Mass Killing Through Policy**: Government policies enabling systematic elderly deaths
- **Institutional Coordination**: Multiple facilities implementing similar practices
- **Documentation Manipulation**: Forged DNRs and missing medical records
- **Cause of Death Misattribution**: Non-COVID deaths certified as COVID-19
- **Family Exclusion**: Systematic removal of advocacy and oversight

### Strategic Implications
- **State-Sanctioned Killing**: Evidence of government policies enabling mass killing
- **Institutional Capture**: Healthcare system implementing lethal policies
- **Democratic Failure**: Complete absence of governmental accountability
- **Media Complicity**: Coordinated suppression of evidence across media platforms

### Legal Implications
- **Criminal Evidence**: Potential evidence of mass manslaughter/murder
- **Fraud**: Forged DNR orders constituting fraud and unlawful killing
- **Human Rights Violations**: Systematic violations of human rights and medical ethics
- **Institutional Liability**: Potential for mass prosecution of healthcare workers and policy makers

## Significance

### Only Truth-Seeking COVID Inquiry
- Described as "world's only official COVID-19 inquiry hearing from families first-hand"
- Contrasts with other inquiries focusing on policy justification rather than harms
- Provides documented evidence of systematic institutional failures
- Demonstrates potential for official investigation when properly conducted

### Evidence for Accountability Campaigns
- Validates [[Entity - Mark Sexton]]'s allegations of mass killing through government policy
- Supports criminal complaints alleging misconduct in public office and manslaughter
- Provides documented evidence for International Criminal Court applications
- Demonstrates systematic institutional failure requiring international intervention

### Precedent for Future Investigations
- Model for family-centered inquiry methodology
- Evidence that official investigations can reveal institutional failures
