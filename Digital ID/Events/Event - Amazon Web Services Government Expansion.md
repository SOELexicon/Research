- **Why**: Consolidate cloud services, modernize digital identity infrastructure, and standardize security compliance while negotiating cost savings after DOGE contract reviews.

## Detailed Description
Following the 2024 contract audits that cancelled $1.4 billion in Accenture projects, DOGE and GSA renegotiated framework agreements with leading cloud vendors. On 7 August 2025, GSA announced an expanded OneGov contract with AWS valued at up to $10 billion over five years (ceiling), with an estimated $1 billion in projected savings through predefined pricing, reserved compute capacity, and professional services credits.

Key features include:
- **Bundled Services**: Identity and access management (AWS IAM), Amazon Cognito, Amazon One palm-recognition pilots, and GovCloud infrastructure.
- **Security Alignment**: FedRAMP High / DoD IL5, plus Zero Trust Architecture guidance co-developed with CISA.
- **Professional Services**: AWS to provide 200,000 staff-hours of modernization support, including migration of legacy identity systems.
- **Digital Identity Use Cases**: Integration with government login systems (Login.gov), DMV modernization, and digital credential projects (REAL ID, veteran benefits).

## Participants
- **GSA Federal Acquisition Service**: Manages OneGov contract expansion.
- **DOGE**: Oversight to ensure anti-waste measures and vendor diversification.
- **AWS Public Sector**: Dave Levy (VP) announced dedicated "Digital Identity Accelerator" for agencies.
- **Partner Agencies**: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, several state motor vehicle agencies participating via cooperative agreements.

## Timeline
- **2024-09**: DOGE cancels Accenture contracts (see [[Event - DOGE Accenture Contract Cancellation 1.4 Billion]]).

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Consolidation of identity workloads on AWS GovCloud, raising vendor lock-in concerns addressed in [[Finding - Corporate Vendor Lock-in Architecture 2024-2025]].
- Introduction of AWS "Digital Identity Accelerator" offering incentives (training, funding) for agencies adopting AWS-native identity services.
- Increased competition scrutiny from Congress; antitrust subcommittee requests audit of cloud dependencies.
- GSA commits to periodic price reviews and optionality clauses for multi-cloud integration.

## Documentation & Evidence
- GSA press release (August 7, 2025).
- AWS newsroom announcement detailing OneGov expansion.
- DOGE quarterly procurement report Q3 FY2025.
- Washington Technology and Federal News Network coverage.
- Congressional testimony (House Oversight Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, October 2025).

## Significance
This event highlights AWS's growing dominance in U.S. government digital infrastructure and identity services. While marketed as cost-saving, the expansion reinforces dependencies on proprietary tools, influencing other nations through AWS's global public sector strategy. The move ties directly into [[Investigation - Digital ID Acceleration and Corporate Consolidation]].
