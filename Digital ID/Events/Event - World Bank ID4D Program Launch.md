# Event: World Bank ID4D Program Launch

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Launch of the World Bank's Identification for Development (ID4D) initiative to finance and coordinate global digital identity systems
- **When**: 28 April 2014 (initial commitments spanning 2014-2015)
- **Where**: World Bank Group headquarters, Washington, D.C., with parallel donor announcements

## Detailed Description
The World Bank's ID4D initiative was formally launched in 2014 to address the lack of legal identity for over a billion people worldwide. The program pools funding, technical assistance, and policy expertise to help countries design and implement digital identity systems—often biometric and linked to national registries.

Initial funding commitments included $200 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and pledges from the UK Department for International Development (DFID), Canada, and Norway. ID4D established a multi-donor trust fund, technical working groups, and partnerships with UN agencies (UNDP, UNICEF), regional banks, and private-sector vendors. Project financing prioritized countries in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, linking identity programs to social protection, financial inclusion, and e-government services.
