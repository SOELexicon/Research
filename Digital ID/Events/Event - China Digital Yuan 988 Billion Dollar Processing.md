# Event: China Digital Yuan 988 Billion Dollar Processing

## Quick Facts
- **What**: China's digital yuan processed 7.3 trillion yuan ($988 billion) through June 2025
- **When**: Through June 2025 (cumulative processing milestone)
- **Where**: [[Entity - China]] (17 provinces operational)
- **Who**: People's Bank of China, 260 million wallet holders
- **Why**: CBDC implementation with social credit integration capabilities

## Detailed Description
China's digital yuan achieved a massive processing milestone, handling 7.3 trillion yuan ($988 billion) through June 2025, with 260 million digital wallets opened across the system. The CBDC now operates across 17 provinces with explicit social credit integration capabilities, enabling the restriction of access based on social scores.
