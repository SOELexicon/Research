# Event: Canada Immigration Surge Housing Crisis 2022-2024

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Historic immigration surge creating unprecedented housing affordability crisis
- **When**: 2022-2024 (peak period)
- **Where**: [[Entity - Canada]], particularly [[Entity - Ontario]] and [[Entity - British Columbia]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Justin Trudeau]] government, millions of newcomers, Canadian residents
- **Why**: Post-pandemic labour shortage response creating unintended housing market consequences

## Detailed Description
Between 2022 and early 2024, Canada experienced a population boom of unprecedented magnitude driven by an extraordinary surge in non-permanent residents (NPRs), including international students and temporary foreign workers. The annual population growth rate peaked at 3.1% in 2023, far exceeding any year from 1972 to 2021 and surpassing all other G7 nations.

This massive influx was actively encouraged by government policy to ease post-pandemic labour shortages, but the sheer scale and speed placed unprecedented strain on Canada's housing market and public services. By 2023, temporary residents constituted 6.2% of the country's population, numbering around 2.5 million people. The correlation between rapid population growth and soaring housing costs became the dominant political issue, leading to widespread public backlash that would ultimately trigger the government's collapse.

## Significance
The immigration surge and resulting housing crisis represents the defining domestic policy failure of the Trudeau era, directly causing the political upheaval that led to his resignation and the 2025 federal election. The crisis demonstrated the interconnectedness of immigration, housing, and political stability in Canada.

The event illustrates how well-intentioned policy responses to one crisis (labour shortages) can create unintended consequences that become even more politically damaging. The housing affordability crisis became the primary lens through which Canadians evaluated government performance, overshadowing other policy achievements.

## Economic Impact Analysis
### Housing Market Metrics
- National average home price: $664,078 (August 2025)
- Toronto and Vancouver: Average prices exceeding $1 million
- Most Canadians spending 35-50% of income on shelter and utilities
- Rental market severely strained across major urban centers

### Regional Variations
- Ontario: 15 consecutive quarters of net population loss to other provinces
- Alberta: 12 consecutive quarters of net population gain
- Urban concentration intensifying affordability pressures
- Rural areas less affected but experiencing spillover effects
