# Event: Switzerland Electronic ID Referendum 2025

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Second nationwide referendum on introducing electronic identity cards (e-ID) in Switzerland
- **When**: September 28, 2025 (referendum voting day)
- **Where**: Switzerland (nationwide ballot)
- **Who**: Swiss citizens voting on government-proposed digital ID system
- **Why**: Address privacy concerns from 2021 rejection while enabling digital government services

## Detailed Description

Switzerland held its second referendum on electronic identity cards on September 28, 2025, with the proposal narrowly passing by 50.4% to 49.6%. This follows the rejection of a similar proposal in 2021 over data protection concerns and opposition to private sector involvement.

The revised 2025 proposal addressed previous concerns by:
- Making the system entirely optional
- Keeping all operations in public hands (no private companies)  
- Storing data on users' smartphones rather than centrally
- Limiting data access to specific verified attributes only

Despite parliamentary approval with large majorities in both chambers, the opposition collected over 50,000 signatures to force the referendum, citing concerns that privacy guarantees were insufficient. The referendum comes as digital ID systems proliferate globally, with the UK announcing mandatory digital ID for all workers just one day before the Swiss vote ([[Event - UK Digital ID Mandatory Work Requirement 2025]]). Unlike the UK's mandatory employment-based system, Switzerland's proposal maintains strong privacy protections and optional participation, reflecting the country's tradition of banking secrecy and citizen privacy rights.

## Key Features of Proposed System
- **Optional participation**: Citizens can continue using physical ID cards
- **Decentralized storage**: Data stored on personal devices, not central databases  
- **Attribute verification**: Authorities can only verify specific details (age, nationality) as needed
- **Public control**: Fully government-operated system with no private sector involvement
- **Privacy-by-design**: Built-in limitations on data collection and use

## Participants
- **Swiss Federal Council**: Recommended "Yes" vote, emphasizing convenience and security
- **Swiss Parliament**: Both houses approved the proposal with large majorities
- **Opposition Committee**: Led by Jonas Sulzer, collected 50,000+ signatures citing missing privacy guarantees
- **CH Association**: Campaign organization supporting e-ID (Olga Baranova, Secretary General)
- **Citizens**: 5.5 million eligible voters, 49.5% turnout, narrow 50.4% approval

## Historical Context
- **2021 Referendum**: First e-ID proposal rejected over privacy and private sector concerns
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Swiss citizens gained experience with government digital IDs through vaccination certificates
- **European Context**: Part of broader European digital identity initiatives ([[Event - EU Digital Identity Wallet Rollout]])

## Timeline
- **2021**: First digital ID referendum rejected by Swiss voters
- **2021-2024**: Government redesigns system addressing privacy concerns
- **2024**: Parliament approves revised proposal with large majorities in both chambers
- **2024**: Opposition collects 50,000+ signatures to force referendum
- **2025-09-28**: Referendum voting day with 49.5% turnout
- **2025-09-28 16:37**: Final results announced - e-ID passes 50.4% to 49.6%
- **Post-referendum**: Government must address communication gaps and privacy concerns during implementation

## Privacy Protection Measures
Reflecting Switzerland's strong privacy tradition:
- Limited CCTV deployment compared to European neighbors
- Google Street View restrictions near sensitive locations
- Historical banking secrecy laws (though now diluted)
- Constitutional privacy protections

## Opposition Concerns
Despite revisions, opponents argue:
- Potential for mission creep and expanded surveillance
- Risk of data tracking for marketing purposes
- Erosion of traditional Swiss privacy protections
- Precedent for future government data collection

## Global Context
- **UK Digital ID**: Mandatory work requirement announced day before Swiss vote ([[Event - UK Digital ID Mandatory Work Requirement 2025]])
- **EU eIDAS 2.0**: Broader European digital identity wallet rollout ([[Event - EU Digital Identity Wallet Rollout]])
- **Digital ID Proliferation**: Global trend toward government digital identity systems
- **Contrasting Approaches**: Swiss optional privacy-focused system vs UK mandatory employment control

## Final Results & Analysis
- **Vote Outcome**: e-ID approved 50.4% to 49.6% (margin of ~22,000 votes)
- **Turnout**: 49.5% (higher than expected 50%)
- **Geographic Pattern**: Support concentrated in German-speaking regions; opposition in French/Italian areas
- **Decisive Factor**: Zurich canton votes pushed proposal over the line
- **Parliamentary vs. Popular Support**: Large parliamentary majority contrasted with narrow public approval

## Political Analysis
- **Growing Mistrust**: Political scientist Lukas Golder noted increasing skepticism of state digital solutions since COVID
- **Communication Gap**: CH association called for better government explanation of digital technology challenges
- **Opposition Concerns**: Referendum committee cited "missing guarantees" in the law
- **Rural-Urban Divide**: Clear mobilization in rural German-speaking areas

## Outcomes & Implications
- **Narrow Mandate**: Slim victory suggests ongoing public skepticism about digital ID
- **Implementation Challenge**: Government must address privacy concerns during rollout
- **Democratic Process**: Demonstrates Swiss direct democracy's role in digital rights decisions
- **European Context**: Provides cautionary tale for privacy-focused digital ID implementation
- **Future Rollout**: Phased implementation expected through 2025-2026 with enhanced privacy safeguards
