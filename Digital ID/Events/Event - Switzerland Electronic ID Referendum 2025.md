# Event: Switzerland Electronic ID Referendum 2025

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Second nationwide referendum on introducing electronic identity cards (e-ID) in Switzerland
- **When**: January 19, 2025 (referendum voting day)
- **Where**: Switzerland (nationwide ballot)
- **Who**: Swiss citizens voting on government-proposed digital ID system
- **Why**: Address privacy concerns from 2021 rejection while enabling digital government services

## Detailed Description

Switzerland held its second referendum on electronic identity cards on January 19, 2025, with early projections showing voters evenly split on the issue. This follows the rejection of a similar proposal in 2021 over data protection concerns and opposition to private sector involvement.

The revised 2025 proposal addressed previous concerns by:
- Making the system entirely optional
- Keeping all operations in public hands (no private companies)
- Storing data on users' smartphones rather than centrally
- Limiting data access to specific verified attributes only

The referendum comes as digital ID systems proliferate globally, with the UK announcing similar plans to combat illegal migration. Unlike broader implementations elsewhere, Switzerland's proposal maintains strong privacy protections reflecting the country's tradition of banking secrecy and citizen privacy rights.

## Key Features of Proposed System
- **Optional participation**: Citizens can continue using physical ID cards
- **Decentralized storage**: Data stored on personal devices, not central databases  
- **Attribute verification**: Authorities can only verify specific details (age, nationality) as needed
- **Public control**: Fully government-operated system with no private sector involvement
- **Privacy-by-design**: Built-in limitations on data collection and use

## Participants
- **Swiss Federal Council**: Recommends "Yes" vote, emphasizing convenience and security
- **Swiss Parliament**: Both houses approved the proposal prior to referendum
- **Privacy advocates**: Organized signature collection to force the referendum
- **Citizens**: Split response with early projections showing 50-50 vote

## Historical Context
- **2021 Referendum**: First e-ID proposal rejected over privacy and private sector concerns
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Swiss citizens gained experience with government digital IDs through vaccination certificates
- **European Context**: Part of broader European digital identity initiatives ([[Event - EU Digital Identity Wallet Rollout]])

## Timeline
- **2021**: First digital ID referendum rejected by Swiss voters
- **2021-2024**: Government redesigns system addressing privacy concerns
- **2024**: Parliament approves revised proposal
- **2024 Q4**: Opposition gathers signatures to force referendum
- **2025-01-19**: Referendum voting day
- **2025-01-19 Evening**: Results expected (too close to call based on early projections)

## Privacy Protection Measures
Reflecting Switzerland's strong privacy tradition:
- Limited CCTV deployment compared to European neighbors
- Google Street View restrictions near sensitive locations
- Historical banking secrecy laws (though now diluted)
- Constitutional privacy protections

## Opposition Concerns
Despite revisions, opponents argue:
- Potential for mission creep and expanded surveillance
- Risk of data tracking for marketing purposes
- Erosion of traditional Swiss privacy protections
- Precedent for future government data collection

## Global Context
- **UK Digital ID**: Announced same week for immigration control purposes
- **EU eIDAS 2.0**: Broader European digital identity wallet rollout
- **Digital ID Proliferation**: Global trend toward government digital identity systems

## Outcomes & Implications
- **Democratic Process**: Demonstrates Swiss direct democracy in action on digital rights
- **Privacy Standards**: Test case for balancing convenience with privacy protection
- **European Influence**: Potential model for privacy-focused digital ID implementation
- **Future Implementation**: If approved, phased rollout expected through 2025-2026
