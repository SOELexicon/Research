# Event - Super Typhoon Ragasa Multi-Country Devastation

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Super Typhoon Ragasa devastated three countries with unprecedented intensity
- **When**: September 23-25, 2025
- **Where**: [[Entity - Philippines]], [[Entity - Taiwan]], [[Entity - China]]
- **Who**: Millions affected across three nations
- **Why**: Climate change intensifying storm systems with warmer ocean temperatures

## Detailed Description
Super Typhoon Ragasa struck the Western Pacific from September 23-25, 2025, as the strongest storm of the year with sustained winds equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane (165 mph) and minimum pressure of 905 hPa. The typhoon devastated three countries in succession, killing dozens and demonstrating the accelerating impact of climate change on storm intensity and frequency. Ragasa marked the ninth typhoon to hit Hong Kong in 2025—significantly above the typical six—while scientists warned that climate change is making storms more frequent and powerful due to higher atmospheric moisture and warm ocean temperatures.

The typhoon's unprecedented intensity and the seasonal pattern of increased storm frequency provided stark evidence of climate change acceleration, with all hurricanes in 2025 reaching major strength (Category 3 or higher)—an unprecedented pattern suggesting intensifying climate impacts on global weather systems.

## Participants

## Significance
Super Typhoon Ragasa represents a watershed moment in climate change acceleration, demonstrating how warming ocean temperatures and increased atmospheric moisture are creating unprecedented storm systems that exceed historical patterns. The storm's Category 5 intensity, combined with the fact that 2025 has seen nine typhoons hit Hong Kong versus a typical six, provides stark evidence of climate change's immediate and measurable impact on extreme weather frequency and intensity.

The event highlights critical vulnerabilities in regional infrastructure and emergency preparedness while demonstrating both the possibilities and limitations of modern disaster response. China's successful evacuation of 1.89 million people showed effective emergency management, while Taiwan's dam collapse catastrophe revealed infrastructure vulnerabilities to extreme weather events.
