### Distinction from Previous Complaint
**Original Complaint (6029679/21):**
- Filed December 2021
- Closed February 2022
- Subject of failed judicial review (dismissed March 2024)
- 27 months elapsed between first and second crime reports

**New Complaint (01/62447/24):**
- Issued March 8, 2024
- Initially handled by Acton Police Station
- Later engagement with Charing Cross Police Station
- Different legal strategy focusing on individual assault claims
- Designed for mass participation by vaccine-injured
- Specific named defendants (not general government)
- Broader range of criminal charges

### Legal Strategy

**Fraud Allegations:**
- Vaccine promoted as "safe and effective" despite unknown safety/efficacy
- Pfizer contracts admit long-term effects unknown
- Manufacturers withheld trial data
- Government suppressed alternative treatments
- Victims deceived into taking unsafe product

**Informed Consent Violations:**
- Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board 2015 standard not met
- Recipients not informed of experimental nature
- Long-term risks not disclosed
- Alternative treatments not discussed
- Participants not told they were in trial

**Assault Charges (Offences Against the Person Act 1861):**
- Vaccine injuries constitute assault against person
- Injuries caused by fraud (lack of informed consent)
- Criminal liability under 1861 Act
- Individual victims can file criminal complaints
- Mass complaint strategy to Crime Number 01/62447/24

### Mass Mobilization Strategy
Mark Sexton's public instruction:
> "I suggest you make contact with The Metropolitan Police stating you want to make a criminal complaint of assault and to add your details to crime number 01/62447/24."

**Implications:**
- Potentially thousands of individual assault complaints
- Each vaccine-injured person becomes complainant
- Overwhelms police capacity to ignore
- Creates individual criminal cases, not single political complaint
- Transforms systemic issue into mass criminal accountability

## Andrew Bridgen MP Involvement

### Parliamentary Intervention
- Wrote two-page letter to Metropolitan Police
- Requested urgent meeting with Sir Mark Rowley (Commissioner)
- Supporting Mark Sexton's criminal complaint efforts
- Using MP status to escalate accountability demands

### Significance
- Parliamentary backing for criminal investigation
- Political pressure on Metropolitan Police
- Elevates issue from citizen complaint to MP intervention
- Creates public record of parliamentary concern

## MI5 Contact - March 20, 2024

### Call Details
- Time: 10:25am, Wednesday, March 20, 2024
- MI5 initiated contact with Mark Sexton
- Discussion of terrorism offences
- Sexton demanded action from security services and police

### Terrorism Offences Context
Mark Sexton's characterization:
> "The deaths and injuries are through the roof as a result of this domestic terrorist attack against the people."

**Legal Framework:**
- Terrorism Act 2000 and subsequent legislation
- Domestic terrorism: acts designed to influence government/intimidate public
- Mass casualties from government policy potentially terrorism
- State actors can commit terrorism under UK law

### Public Commentary
**DANNY RAMPLING:**
> "The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Thank you Mark for leading the way to justice. Now, are we going to see action being taken by the authorities, towards offences identified."

**Mark Sexton response:**
> "We have to keep pushing and pushing. There are no excuses. The deaths and injuries are through the roof as a result of this domestic terrorist attack against the people."

### Implications of MI5 Contact
- Security services taking allegations seriously (or monitoring Sexton)
- Terrorism framework potentially applicable to state COVID crimes
- Escalation beyond standard criminal complaint
- National security implications recognized

## Legal Framework

### Offences Against the Person Act 1861
Mark Sexton's legal basis for assault charges:
- Victorian-era law still in force
- Covers bodily harm and assault
- Vaccine injuries as assault if obtained by fraud/deception
- Individual criminal liability for each injury

### Fraud Act 2006
Referenced in Sexton's mobilization (Section 2):
- Fraud by false representation
- "Safe and effective" claims as false representation
- Intent to make gain or cause loss
- Victims deceived into vaccine uptake

### Montgomery v Lanarkshire 2015
Informed consent standard:
- Patients must be informed of material risks
- Alternative treatments must be discussed
- Right to make own medical decisions
- Failure to inform constitutes negligence (can support assault claim if injury results)

### Terrorism Legislation
Potential framework if MI5 involved:
- Terrorism Act 2000
- State terrorism provisions
- Mass casualties and intimidation
- Political objectives through violence/serious damage

## Comparison to Previous Strategies

### Evolution of Legal Approach

**Phase 1 (Dec 2021 - Feb 2022):** Single criminal complaint CRN 6029679/21
- Result: Police closed case

**Phase 2 (Jun 2023 - Mar 2024):** Judicial review of closure
- Result: High Court and Court of Appeal dismissed

**Phase 3 (Mar 2024 - Present):** New complaint CRN 01/62447/24 + mass mobilization
- Strategy: Individual assault complaints by vaccine-injured
- Andrew Bridgen MP parliamentary pressure
- MI5 engagement on terrorism framework
- Overwhelm police with volume of complaints

**Phase 4 (Future):** ICC application

### Strategic Innovation
