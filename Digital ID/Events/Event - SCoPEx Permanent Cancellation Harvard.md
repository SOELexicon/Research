# Event - SCoPEx Permanent Cancellation Harvard

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Complete and permanent cancellation of Harvard's SCoPEx experiment and associated research
- **When**: March 15, 2024 at 14:00 EST (official announcement)
- **Where**: Harvard University, [[Entity - United States]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program]] administration
- **Significance**: Abandonment of first major outdoor geoengineering experiment due to governance failures

## Detailed Description
The March 15, 2024 permanent cancellation of Harvard's [[Entity - Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment]] represented the complete institutional retreat from outdoor geoengineering experimentation following three years of sustained opposition, governance failures, and recognition of inadequate consultation frameworks. The cancellation marked the end of the most ambitious attempt to transition geoengineering research from computer modeling to real-world atmospheric testing, demonstrating that academic institutions cannot unilaterally authorize planetary-scale atmospheric intervention without democratic consent and adequate governance frameworks.

The decision followed the 2021 cancellation of the Sweden experiment due to [[Entity - Saami Council]] opposition, Harvard's failed attempts to relocate the experiment to other jurisdictions, and growing recognition that outdoor geoengineering experimentation requires governance frameworks that do not exist. The permanent cancellation effectively ended Harvard's leadership in outdoor geoengineering research and marked a broader institutional recognition of the governance crisis surrounding planetary atmospheric intervention.

## Background Leading to Cancellation
