## Detailed Description
The Clinton Global Initiative launched in 2005, pioneering a revolutionary new model of philanthropy centered on convening and action rather than direct funding. The initiative's core innovation was the "Commitment to Action" requirement - participants must pledge to undertake a new, specific, and measurable project to attend the high-profile annual meeting.

CGI's role was designed to act as a "catalyst" and "marketplace," connecting leaders from public, private, and nonprofit sectors to foster partnerships and find resources. This model effectively leveraged President Clinton's unparalleled convening power to mobilize action on a global scale, representing a fundamental departure from traditional grant-making foundations.

The launch established CGI as a premium networking platform where attendance became a status symbol among global elites, with reported attendance costs of $20,000. The model created a unique dynamic where philanthropic commitments became intertwined with high-level political and business networking.
