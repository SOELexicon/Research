# Event: Bilderberg 2019 Meeting Montreux

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Bilderberg Meeting coordinating AI surveillance and pandemic response preparation
- **When**: May 30-June 2, 2019
- **Where**: Montreux, [[Entity - Switzerland]]
- **Who**: 130 participants including GCHQ Director and AI surveillance leaders
- **Why**: Coordinate AI surveillance deployment and pandemic response infrastructure months before COVID-19

## Detailed Description
The 2019 Bilderberg Meeting in Montreux proved pivotal in coordinating global digital surveillance infrastructure, featuring agenda items on "The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence" and "The Weaponisation of Social Media" months before the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated worldwide digital transformation. The meeting brought together surveillance technology leaders including GCHQ Director [[Entity - Jeremy Fleming]] with corporate AI architects to coordinate surveillance deployment that would be implemented during the pandemic response.

This meeting established the critical pattern of Bilderberg coordination preceding major policy implementations by 12-24 months, with AI surveillance and social media weaponization discussions directly preceding the global deployment of digital health passports, tracking systems, and comprehensive population surveillance during 2020-2021.

## Official Agenda Analysis

### "The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence"
