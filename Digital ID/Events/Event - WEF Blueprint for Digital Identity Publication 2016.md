# Event: WEF Blueprint for Digital Identity Publication 2016

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Publication of "A Blueprint for Digital Identity" by WEF and Deloitte
- **When**: 2016
- **Who**: [[Entity - World Economic Forum]], [[Entity - Deloitte]]
- **Significance**: Established corporate-led framework for global digital ID implementation

## Description

The [[Entity - World Economic Forum]]'s collaboration with [[Entity - Deloitte]] on **"A Blueprint for Digital Identity"** was a pivotal moment in the formation of the [[Investigation - Digital Identity-Industrial Complex Global Architecture]]. This report established the fundamental argument that **"financial institutions are well positioned to drive the creation of digital identity systems"** and outlined the business case based on efficiency gains and new revenue opportunities.

## Key Arguments

### Corporate Leadership Framing
**Primary Thesis**: Private sector, particularly financial institutions, should **lead** digital identity development, with government as enabler rather than primary architect.

**Business Case:**
- Efficiency gains from automated verification
- New revenue opportunities from identity-as-a-service
- Reduced fraud costs
- Streamlined customer onboarding

### Economic Justification
The report helped establish the economic narrative used throughout the DIIC:
- Digital ID as driver of GDP growth
- Foundation for [[Entity - McKinsey]] projections: [[Finding - WEF McKinsey Digital ID GDP Value Projection 3-13 Percent]]
- "Essential" for Fourth Industrial Revolution

## Impact on Global Policy

### Blueprint for Implementation
The 2016 report created template followed globally:
1. **Public-Private Partnerships**: Blend government authority with corporate technology
2. **Biometric Standards**: Promote biometric verification as default
3. **Interoperability**: Push for linked systems across borders and sectors
4. **Financial Sector Hub**: Position banks/fintechs as identity providers

### [[Finding - WEF Fourth Industrial Revolution Digital ID Nexus]]
Positioned digital identity as **foundational infrastructure** for:
- Internet of Things integration
- Smart cities
- Automated service delivery
- AI-driven governance

## Corporate Capture Pattern

### [[Finding - Policy-to-Procurement Pipeline TBI-Oracle Model]]
The WEF-Deloitte collaboration exemplifies:
1. **Policy Development**: Consulting firm helps develop framework
2. **Standards Setting**: Influence technical requirements
3. **Implementation Contracts**: Same firms win government contracts

**Deloitte's Role:**
- Co-author policy blueprint
- Advise governments on implementation
- Bid for systems integration contracts
- Benefit from standards they helped create
