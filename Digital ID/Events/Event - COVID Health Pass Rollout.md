# Event - COVID Health Pass Rollout

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Global implementation of digital health certificates for COVID-19 control
- **When**: March 2020 - ongoing
- **Where**: Worldwide implementation across 100+ countries
- **Who**: National governments, [[Entity - World Health Organization]], technology companies
- **Why**: Crisis exploitation to accelerate digital identity adoption

## Detailed Description
The COVID-19 pandemic provided unprecedented justification for rapid implementation of digital health pass systems globally, requiring digital identity verification to access basic services including travel, employment, dining, and healthcare. Initially presented as temporary emergency measures, these systems established digital identity infrastructure that persisted beyond the health emergency, demonstrating the systematic exploitation of crisis events to accelerate authoritarian digital control mechanisms.
