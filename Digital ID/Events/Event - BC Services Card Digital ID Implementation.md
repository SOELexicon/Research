# Event: BC Services Card Digital ID Implementation

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Launch and expansion of BC Services Card digital identity system
- **When**: 2018-present (ongoing expansion)
- **Where**: [[Entity - British Columbia]], [[Entity - Canada]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Government of British Columbia]], integrated with federal services
- **Why**: Provincial leadership in digital identity in absence of federal framework

## Detailed Description
[[Entity - British Columbia]] has emerged as the national leader in digital identity implementation through its BC Services Card system, which provides a digital ID that can be used to securely access a wide range of provincial and federal services. The system allows secure login to dozens of government services, including the Health Gateway and [[Entity - Canada Revenue Agency]] services, demonstrating successful federal-provincial integration despite the lack of national coordination.

The BC Services Card Account offers both app-based authentication and traditional username/password options, providing flexibility for users while maintaining security standards. The system has become a model for other provinces, though the [[Event - Auditor General Digital ID Federal Failure Report 2024]] highlighted concerns about the lack of national coordination ensuring interoperability with other provincial systems.

## Participants
### Government Entities
- [[Entity - Government of British Columbia]] - Primary implementer and system operator
- [[Entity - Canada Revenue Agency]] - Federal partner providing service integration
- [[Entity - BC Health Services]] - Major provincial service integration
- BC citizens - Primary users of the system

### Technical Implementation
- Digital identity technology providers (specific vendors not detailed in source)
- Privacy and security compliance frameworks
- Service delivery partners across government

## Timeline
- **2018**: Initial BC Services Card digital implementation
- **2018-2024**: Gradual expansion of integrated services
- **2024**: System includes dozens of provincial and federal services
- **December 2024**: [[Event - Auditor General Digital ID Federal Failure Report 2024]] highlights BC as leading example
- **Present**: Ongoing expansion and refinement

## Outcomes & Decisions
- **Service Integration**: Successful connection to both provincial and federal services
- **User Adoption**: Widespread uptake among BC residents
- **Technical Standards**: Decentralized model with user control over data sharing
- **Privacy Model**: No central activity tracking, transaction-by-transaction consent

## Documentation & Evidence
- [[Research - Canada's Population, Government, Digital ID]] - Analysis of BC implementation
- BC Services Card official government documentation
- Privacy framework descriptions from BC government
- Integration agreements with federal services

## Significance
The BC Services Card represents the most successful implementation of digital identity in Canada, demonstrating both the potential benefits of the technology and the consequences of federal leadership failure. By moving ahead independently, BC has created a model that other provinces are following, but without national coordination, raising concerns about interoperability and consistent security standards across Canada.

The system's success has provided evidence for digital ID proponents while also highlighting the privacy-protective design principles that critics argue must be embedded in any national framework.

## Privacy and Security Features
### Decentralized Architecture
- User maintains control over data sharing decisions
- No central government database aggregating citizen data
- Transaction-by-transaction consent mechanism
- Advanced encryption protecting user information

### Access Control
- User-controlled data sharing per transaction
- No central activity tracking by government
- Privacy-by-design implementation
- Voluntary participation maintained
