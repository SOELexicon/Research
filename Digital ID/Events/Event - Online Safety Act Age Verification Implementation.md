# Event - Online Safety Act Age Verification Implementation

## Quick Facts
- **What**: UK Online Safety Act Highly Effective Age Assurance (HEAA) requirements become fully enforceable
- **When**: July 25, 2025
- **Where**: [[Entity - United Kingdom]] affecting millions of users globally
- **Who**: [[Entity - Ofcom]], technology platforms, age verification providers, UK and international users
- **Why**: Implementing mass identity collection system eliminating digital anonymity under child protection narrative

## Detailed Description
July 25, 2025, marked the activation of the UK's Highly Effective Age Assurance (HEAA) requirements, representing the operational launch of one of the world's largest mass identity collection systems. Under the guise of protecting children from adult content, the implementation created comprehensive databases of citizen personal information while eliminating the presumption of anonymous internet access for millions of users.
