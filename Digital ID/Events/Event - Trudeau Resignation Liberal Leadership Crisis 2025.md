## Detailed Description
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his intention to step down as Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister on January 6, 2025, following a cascading political crisis that made his position untenable. The announcement came after his personal approval rating had fallen to an all-time low of 22% by the end of 2024, with nearly half of Canadians believing he should resign immediately.

The immediate trigger was the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister [[Entity - Chrystia Freeland]], which sparked a caucus revolt within the Liberal Party. Polling throughout 2024 had shown the opposition Conservative Party, led by [[Entity - Pierre Poilievre]], holding a commanding lead of up to 24 points, pointing toward a crushing electoral defeat for the incumbent government.

The crisis was fundamentally driven by widespread public frustration over the cost of living and housing unaffordability, issues that had become the dominant political concern following the [[Event - Canada Immigration Surge Housing Crisis 2022-2024]].
