# Event: Algeria 500K Donation State Department Lobbying

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Algeria government $500,000 donation to Clinton Foundation without required State Department review
- **When**: January 2010 (Haiti earthquake relief)
- **Where**: [[Entity - Algeria]] to [[Entity - Clinton Foundation]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Algeria Government]], [[Entity - Clinton Foundation]], [[Entity - State Department]]
- **Why**: Ostensibly for Haiti earthquake relief; coincided with Algeria lobbying efforts

## Detailed Description
In January 2010, the Algerian government donated $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation, designated for Haiti earthquake relief efforts. This donation represented a clear violation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that the Clinton Foundation had signed with the Obama Administration during Hillary Clinton's confirmation as Secretary of State.

The MOU specifically required that any new foreign government donations, or material increases from existing donors, be submitted to the State Department for ethics review before acceptance. Algeria was considered a "new" government donor, having not previously contributed to the foundation, making the ethics review mandatory.

The violation was particularly significant because it occurred during a period when Algeria was actively increasing its lobbying efforts at the State Department regarding its human rights record and other policy matters. The timing created a clear appearance that the Algerian government was attempting to curry favor with the Clinton family while Hillary Clinton was serving as Secretary of State.

## Significance Analysis
### MOU Violation Implications
