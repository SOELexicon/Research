# Event - Make Sunsets Unauthorized Geoengineering Operations

## Quick Facts
- **What**: First commercial unauthorized stratospheric aerosol injection operations
- **When**: October 1, 2022 (first documented operations)
- **Where**: [[Entity - Mexico]] (initial operations), expanding globally
- **Who**: [[Entity - Make Sunsets]] - commercial geoengineering startup
- **Significance**: Demonstrates complete governance failure for planetary atmospheric intervention

## Detailed Description
[[Entity - Make Sunsets]] became the first commercial entity to conduct unauthorized stratospheric aerosol injection operations, launching weather balloons filled with sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere without regulatory approval, scientific oversight, or democratic consent. Operating from California with initial deployments in Mexico, the company represents the catastrophic failure of global governance systems to prevent unilateral planetary atmospheric modification. Their operations demonstrate how low technological barriers and absent regulatory frameworks enable individual actors to deploy planet-affecting interventions for commercial profit.

The company, founded by entrepreneur Luke Iseman, explicitly positioned itself as conducting geoengineering operations to "cool the planet" while selling "cooling credits" to customers, creating a commercial market for atmospheric intervention. Their balloon-based sulfur injection system requires minimal technical infrastructure and capital investment, proving that planetary-scale atmospheric modification can be conducted by small private entities without authorization from any government or international organization.

## Pre-Event Context and Background

### Regulatory Environment
- **Legal Vacuum**: No binding international law governing atmospheric intervention
- **National Regulations**: Absence of domestic frameworks for geoengineering oversight
- **Commercial Operations**: No licensing or approval requirements for atmospheric modification
