# Event: Canada Population Growth Historic Slowdown 2025

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Canada's population growth slows to historic lows following policy reversal
- **When**: Second quarter 2025 (April-June)
- **Where**: [[Entity - Canada]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Statistics Canada]] reporting, [[Entity - Mark Carney]] government managing consequences
- **Why**: Direct result of 2024 immigration policy restrictions

## Detailed Description
In the second quarter of 2025, Canada experienced the most dramatic population growth slowdown in decades, with the population growing by just 47,098 people at a quarterly rate of only 0.1%. This marked the slowest second-quarter growth rate since 1946, excluding the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The slowdown was directly attributable to the [[Event - Canada Population Growth Policy Reversal 2024]], which created a net loss of non-permanent residents (NPRs). Between April and June 2025, the NPR population declined by 58,719 people, marking the third consecutive quarterly drop and one of the largest declines since records began in 1971. By January 2025, the NPR population had fallen to 3.02 million (7.3% of total population), down from a peak of 7.6% in October 2024.

## Participants
### Government Entities
- [[Entity - Statistics Canada]] - Demographic monitoring and reporting
- [[Entity - Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] - Policy implementation
- [[Entity - Mark Carney]] - Prime Minister managing demographic transition
- Provincial governments dealing with economic impacts

### Affected Populations
- Non-permanent residents leaving Canada
- Economic sectors dependent on temporary workers
- Aging Canadian population resuming demographic prominence
- Regional communities experiencing labour shortages

### Economic Stakeholders
- Employers in sectors reliant on temporary workers
- Healthcare and social services adapting to aging population
- Economic analysts tracking labour market impacts

## Timeline
- **October 2024**: NPR population peaks at 7.6% of total population
- **January 2025**: NPR population falls to 7.3% (3.02 million people)
- **Q2 2025**: Historic quarterly growth low of 0.1%
- **April-June 2025**: NPR population declines by 58,719
- **July 2025**: Year-over-year growth at just 0.9%
- **2026 target**: Federal goal to reduce NPR share to 5%

## Outcomes & Decisions
- **Demographic Reversal**: Resume of long-term population aging trend
- **Median Age Increase**: Rose from 40.3 years (July 2024) to 40.6 years (July 2025)
- **Senior Population Growth**: 19.5% of population aged 65+, up from 18.9%
- **Regional Variations**: Ontario and BC most affected by NPR exodus
- **Economic Adaptation**: Sectors adjusting to reduced temporary workforce

## Documentation & Evidence
- [[Research - Canada's Population, Government, Digital ID]] - Comprehensive demographic analysis
- Statistics Canada quarterly population estimates
- Immigration policy impact reports
- Economic sector analysis of labour shortages

## Significance
The historic population slowdown represents the immediate consequence of the government's response to the [[Event - Canada Immigration Surge Housing Crisis 2022-2024]]. While intended to relieve housing pressure, the demographic reversal created new economic challenges including resumed population aging and sector-specific labour shortages.

The event demonstrates the complex trade-offs in demographic policy, showing how addressing one crisis (housing affordability) can create new long-term challenges (aging workforce, labour shortages) that may prove more economically damaging than the original problem.

## Demographic Impact Analysis
### Age Structure Changes
- Median age resuming upward trend after temporary reversal
- Newfoundland and Labrador: One in four residents now seniors
- First time 25% senior threshold reached in any province
- Long-term fiscal implications for healthcare and pensions

### Regional Variations
- Ontario and British Columbia: Population growth stalled for two consecutive quarters
- Alberta: Continued net interprovincial migration gains
- Atlantic Canada: Mixed impacts with some growth continuation
- Territories: Less affected by NPR policy changes

### Economic Consequences
- Labour shortages emerging in sectors dependent on temporary workers
- Reduced consumer demand in high-population-growth regions
- Housing market cooling in some segments
- Long-term productivity challenges from aging workforce
