# Event: China's Internet ID Law 2025

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Adoption of China's "Real Identity Information Registration for Internet Services" law (commonly "Internet ID" law) mandating binding of all online activity to verified biometric national IDs.
- **When**: Law passed 1 March 2025; enforcement begins 1 September 2025.
- **Where**: People's Republic of China (nationwide, including Hong Kong and Macau via mainland platforms).
- **Who**: Ministry of Public Security (MPS), Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), National People's Congress (NPC), internet service providers.
- **Why**: Officially to curb cybercrime and "online rumors"; effectively to integrate social credit surveillance with digital communications and e-commerce.

## Detailed Description
The 2025 Internet ID law requires all internet users to authenticate with government-issued ID (居民身份证 for citizens, passport equivalents for foreigners) and submit facial verification before accessing social media, e-commerce, cloud, or messaging services. Platforms must connect to the National Public Security system for real-time identity validation and maintain logs tied to the Social Credit Information Exchange Platform.

Key provisions:
- Mandatory real-name registration for SIMs, messaging apps, cloud storage, gaming, and streaming services.
- Integration with [[Entity - China Social Credit System]] to apply "joint rewards and punishments" for online behavior.
- Data localization and cross-border data transfer controls enforceable by CAC.
- Strict penalties (up to ¥10 million fines, business suspension) for providers failing to verify users.

## Participants
- **Ministry of Public Security**: Leads implementation, leveraging biometric databases.
- **Cyberspace Administration of China**: Issues compliance directives to service providers.
- **Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)**: Oversees telecom integration.
- **Major Tech Platforms**: Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, Baidu responsible for compliance.

## Timeline
- **2024-06**: Draft regulation released for public comment.
- **2024-10**: Pilot testing with major platforms in Beijing and Shanghai.
- **2025-03-01**: Law enacted by NPC Standing Committee.
- **2025-07**: CAC publishes implementation guidelines.
- **2025-09-01**: Mandatory enforcement begins nationwide.

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Consolidates full linkage between online identity and social credit scoring.
- Enables automated censorship and behavior scoring; blacklisted individuals restricted from online payments and travel bookings.
- Sparks international criticism for human rights violations (see Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch statements).
- Influences other authoritarian regimes exploring similar legislation.

## Documentation & Evidence
- NPC Standing Committee legal announcement (March 2025).
- CAC Implementation Guidelines for Internet Real-Name Verification (July 2025).
- MPS press conference transcripts detailing enforcement.
- Analyses by CSIS, ASPI, and Citizen Lab.
- Media coverage: The Hill, South China Morning Post, Nikkei Asia.

## Significance
Marks a major escalation in China's digital authoritarianism by abolishing remaining anonymity online. Integrates network activity with [[Finding - CBDC Programmable Money Control Mechanisms]] and [[Finding - Crisis Events Systematically Exploited for Digital ID Expansion]] (justified by rising cybercrime narrative post-COVID).
