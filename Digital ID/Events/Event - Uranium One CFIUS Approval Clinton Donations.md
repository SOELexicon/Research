# Event: Uranium One CFIUS Approval Clinton Donations

## Quick Facts
- **What**: CFIUS approval of Uranium One sale to Russian Rosatom amid Clinton Foundation donations
- **When**: October 22, 2010 (CFIUS approval); donations 2009-2013
- **Where**: [[Entity - United States]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Uranium One]], [[Entity - Rosatom]], [[Entity - CFIUS]], [[Entity - Hillary Clinton]], [[Entity - Bill Clinton]]
- **Why**: Complex international business transaction requiring U.S. national security review

## Detailed Description
The Uranium One transaction represents one of the most controversial and scrutinized cases in Clinton Foundation history, involving the intersection of international business, national security oversight, and charitable donations. The deal involved the 2010 sale of Uranium One, a Canadian company controlling approximately 20% of U.S. uranium mining capacity, to Rosatom, Russia's state-owned atomic energy agency.

The transaction required approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a nine-agency government body that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets for national security implications. The State Department, then led by Secretary Hillary Clinton, was one of the nine agencies with a vote on the committee, though the Secretary herself did not directly participate in the review process.

The controversy emerged from the timing of significant donations to the Clinton Foundation from individuals connected to Uranium One, combined with a substantial speaking fee paid to Bill Clinton by a Russian investment bank promoting Uranium One stock. These financial flows created a powerful appearance of conflict of interest, even though multiple fact-checking organizations concluded there was no evidence of quid pro quo or inappropriate influence on the approval process.
