# Event: EU Digital Identity Wallet Rollout

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Deployment of European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet pilot programs across EU Member States following the entry into force of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation.
- **When**: Initial rollout wave September 2024; broader adoption targeted for 2025-2026.
- **Where**: All 27 EU member states (pilot consortia in Germany, Spain, France, Italy, and Ukraine (associated program)).
- **Who**: European Commission (DG CONNECT), Member State digital ministries, ETSI, private sector wallet providers.
- **Why**: Provide citizens with interoperable digital wallets for identity, credentials, and payments; achieve 80% adoption by 2030 as mandated by eIDAS 2.0.

## Detailed Description
After eIDAS 2.0 entered into force on 20 May 2024, the European Commission funded Large Scale Pilots (LSPs) to test EUDI Wallet use cases. Consortia such as NOBID (Nordic-Baltic), POTENTIAL, DC4EU, and EWC engaged telecoms, banks, and universities to issue digital credentials (driving licenses, diplomas, bank accounts, SIM registration). By September 2024, Germany, Spain, France, and Israel (associated partner) issued first pilot wallets to citizens, enabling cross-border authentication through ETSI standards.

The EU rollout represents a coordinated approach across **350+ companies and public authorities across 26 member states** plus Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine, making it one of the largest digital identity pilot programs globally.

Key features:
- Wallet apps compliant with ETSI TS 119 495 and ARF (Architecture and Reference Framework).
- Support for verifiable credentials (W3C VC), electronic attestations of attributes (EAAs), and qualified electronic signatures.
- Integration with high-value services (opening bank accounts, signing up for mobile contracts, accessing government portals).

## Participants
- **European Commission DG CONNECT**: Program coordination and funding (~€46 million via DIGITAL Europe).
- **Member State Agencies**: Germany's Federal Agency for Secure Information Technology (BSI), Spain's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, France's ANTS, Italy's PagoPA.
- **Private Sector**: Thales, Atos, IDEMIA, iProov, Signicat, and telecom operators.
- **Scale**: Over 350 companies and public authorities across 26 member states plus Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine participating in pilots.

## EU Physical ID Context
- **Current Status**: 25 of 27 EU member states use standard machine-readable physical ID cards (introduced 2021)
- **Exceptions**: [[Entity - Denmark]] (uses digital MitID app exclusively), [[Entity - Ireland]] (issues passport cards)
- **Schengen Integration**: Physical cards enable travel within passport-free Schengen zone
- **Digital Transition**: EUDI Wallet designed to complement and eventually replace physical systems

## Timeline
- **2024-05**: eIDAS 2.0 enters force (see [[Event - EU eIDAS 2.0 Regulation Entry into Force]]).
- **2024-09**: Pilot wallet apps launched in Germany (BundID app update), Spain (MiCarpeta Ciudadana), France (France Identité advanced pilot - combining identity card, driving licence, and vehicle registration), and Ukraine (Diia integration partnership).
- **2025**: Additional pilots for healthcare, payments, and diploma credentials; evaluation reports due Q4 2025.
- **2026**: Mandatory wallet availability deadline for Member States.

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Demonstrated feasibility of single wallet for multiple credentials.
- Raised security concerns over Article 45a QWAC implementation and browser control highlighted by [[Entity - Mozilla Foundation]].
- Stimulated private sector competition to develop certified wallet providers.
- Provided test cases for cross-border trust services, relevant to [[Finding - Corporate Vendor Lock-in Architecture 2024-2025]] and [[Finding - CBDC Programmable Money Control Mechanisms]].
