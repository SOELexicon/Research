# Event - SCoPEx Sweden Cancellation Indigenous Opposition

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Cancellation of Harvard's SCoPEx balloon experiment due to Indigenous opposition
- **When**: March 31, 2021 at 09:00 CET (final cancellation announcement)
- **Where**: Esrange Space Center, [[Entity - Sweden]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Saami Council]] opposition, [[Entity - Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program]]
- **Outcome**: Permanent experiment cancellation and governance precedent establishment

## Detailed Description
The cancellation of Harvard's [[Entity - Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment]] in Sweden represents the first successful Indigenous-led opposition to outdoor geoengineering research, establishing crucial precedent for consultation requirements in planetary-scale atmospheric intervention. The [[Entity - Saami Council]] mobilized international Indigenous rights frameworks to halt the experiment, invoking free, prior, and informed consent requirements under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Their opposition highlighted fundamental conflicts between Western technological approaches to climate intervention and Indigenous worldviews emphasizing environmental harmony and balance.

The experiment was designed to test stratospheric perturbation equipment by releasing small amounts of reflective particles at 20 km altitude over Swedish territory, which the Saami Council identified as traditional Sámi territory requiring Indigenous consultation. Harvard's failure to seek meaningful Indigenous consent, combined with the experiment's symbolic significance as a step toward full-scale geoengineering deployment, triggered sustained international advocacy that ultimately forced complete project abandonment.

## Pre-Event Background and Context

### SCoPEx Experiment Design
- **Objective**: Test stratospheric balloon equipment for potential future particle release
