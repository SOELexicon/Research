# Event: Auditor General Digital ID Federal Failure Report 2024

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Auditor General report criticizing federal government's digital ID leadership failure
- **When**: December 2024
- **Where**: [[Entity - Canada]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Auditor General of Canada]], [[Entity - Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat]]
- **Why**: Assessment of federal progress on national digital identity framework

## Detailed Description
The [[Entity - Auditor General of Canada]] released a scathing report in December 2024 finding that the [[Entity - Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat]] has made "little progress" in leading the development of a cohesive national approach to digital identity. The report delivered a sharp critique of the federal government's role, attributing this failure to a lack of dedicated funding and a clear strategy.

The audit revealed that Canada has become an outlier among its G7 peers, most of whom have already established national legislation and single sign-in systems for digital identity. The report specifically noted that Canada's global ranking in the UN's E-Government Development Index plummeted from 3rd in 2010 to 32nd in 2022, highlighting the country's declining digital governance performance.

## Participants

## Significance
The Auditor General's report provided authoritative confirmation that Canada's approach to digital identity has been fundamentally flawed by federal inaction. The critique validates concerns that the fragmented, province-led rollout is proceeding without a national framework to ensure security, reliability, and interoperability of disparate systems.

The report's timing, coinciding with the political crisis leading to [[Event - Trudeau Resignation Liberal Leadership Crisis 2025]], highlighted how the government's focus on immediate political fires had led to neglect of important long-term governance modernization.
