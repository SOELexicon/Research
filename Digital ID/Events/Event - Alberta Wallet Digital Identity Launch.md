# Event: Alberta Wallet Digital Identity Launch

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Launch of Alberta Wallet mobile app for digital government documents
- **When**: 2024 (specific launch date not provided in source)
- **Where**: [[Entity - Alberta]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Government of Alberta]], [[Entity - Alberta Health Services]]
- **Why**: Provincial digital identity initiative starting with Mobile Health Card

## Detailed Description
[[Entity - Alberta]] launched the Alberta Wallet, a mobile application designed to hold digital versions of government-issued documents, beginning with the Mobile Health Card. The system represents Alberta's entry into the digital identity space, following the model established by [[Event - BC Services Card Digital ID Implementation]] but with its own distinct approach and privacy framework.

The Alberta Wallet emphasizes user control and voluntary participation, with advanced encryption protecting user information. The system is positioned as completely voluntary and optional, addressing privacy concerns while providing digital convenience for those who choose to participate.

## Participants
### Government Entities
- [[Entity - Government of Alberta]] - Primary system implementer and operator
- [[Entity - Alberta Health Services]] - Partner for Mobile Health Card integration
- Alberta.ca Account system - Underlying digital identity infrastructure
- Alberta residents - Target users of the system

### Implementation Framework
- Mobile app developers and technology partners
- Privacy and security compliance teams
- Service delivery integration partners

## Timeline
- **Pre-2024**: Planning and development phase
- **2024**: Alberta Wallet launch with Mobile Health Card
- **2024-present**: Gradual expansion of document types and services
- **December 2024**: [[Event - Auditor General Digital ID Federal Failure Report 2024]] context highlighting provincial leadership

## Outcomes & Decisions
- **Document Digitization**: Digital Mobile Health Card as initial offering
- **Privacy Framework**: Decentralized model with user authority over data sharing
- **Voluntary Participation**: Emphasis on optional nature of system
- **Expansion Planning**: Framework for adding additional government documents

## Documentation & Evidence
- [[Research - Canada's Population, Government, Digital ID]] - Analysis of Alberta implementation
- Alberta government fact sheet on Alberta Wallet and Mobile Health Card
- Official government announcements and documentation
- Privacy framework documentation

## Significance
The Alberta Wallet launch represents another example of provincial leadership in digital identity in the absence of federal coordination. Alberta's approach emphasizes voluntary participation and user control, positioning it as a privacy-conscious alternative while still providing digital convenience.

The timing of Alberta's implementation alongside other provincial initiatives like [[Event - BC Services Card Digital ID Implementation]] demonstrates the accelerating fragmentation of digital identity systems across Canada, validating the concerns raised in the [[Event - Auditor General Digital ID Federal Failure Report 2024]].

## Privacy and Security Framework
### User Control Principles
- Decentralized architecture maintaining user authority
- Consent-based data sharing for each transaction
- Advanced encryption protecting personal information
- No central government database aggregating citizen data

### Voluntary Participation
- Completely optional system participation
- Traditional non-digital alternatives maintained
- User-controlled activation and deactivation
- Privacy-by-design implementation

## Technical Features
- **Mobile App Platform**: Primary interface for digital documents
- **Document Wallet**: Secure storage for government-issued credentials
- **Health Card Integration**: Initial focus on healthcare document digitization
- **Alberta.ca Integration**: Connection to broader provincial digital services
