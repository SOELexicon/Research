# Event: European Court Human Rights Encryption Ruling

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Landmark ruling that weakening encryption violates fundamental human rights
- **When**: 2025
- **Where**: [[European Court of Human Rights]], [[Strasbourg, France]]
- **Who**: ECHR, *Podchasov v. Russia* case
- **Why**: Challenge to government demands for encryption backdoors

## Detailed Description
The European Court of Human Rights delivered a landmark victory for privacy in the case *Podchasov v. Russia*, ruling that weakening encryption violates fundamental human rights. The court declared that encryption backdoors "could be exploited by criminal networks" and "cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society," directly challenging UK and EU message-scanning proposals. This decision establishes important legal precedent protecting encryption technology and limiting government authority to mandate surveillance capabilities in secure communications systems.
