- **Why**: Combat illegal immigration by preventing undocumented workers from finding employment

## Detailed Description

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced plans for a mandatory [[Entity - Digital Identity Systems]] that will be **compulsory for anyone wanting to work** in the UK. The system represents a significant escalation in digital identity requirements, making employment contingent on digital verification.

Key features of the announcement:
- **Work Mandate**: "You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that." - Sir Keir Starmer
- **App-based system**: Stored on smartphones similar to NHS App or digital bank cards
- **Timeline**: Rollout "by the end of Parliament" (before August 2029 election)
- **Not carried daily**: Unlike traditional ID cards, won't need to be carried in public
- **Selective application**: Mandatory for workers, optional for students/pensioners

## System Specifications

### **Data Included**
- Residency status
- Name and date of birth  
- Nationality
- Photo identification
- Right to work verification

### **Integration Scope**
**Government services** (planned):
- Driving licence applications
- Childcare services
- Welfare applications
- Tax record access

**Private sector** (potential):

## Political Opposition

### **Conservative Party Response**
**Kemi Badenoch** (Conservative Leader):

- Concerns about "additional burdens on law abiding people"

### **Liberal Democrats**
**Ben Maguire** (Shadow Attorney General):
- Party "struggling" to see meaningful impact on illegal migration
- Questions policy effectiveness

### **Cross-Party Regional Opposition**

**Northern Ireland**: United opposition from all major parties
**Common Criticism**: Digital IDs will not stop illegal migration (no alternative proposals offered)

## Immigration Control Strategy

- Photo attachment to prevent identity fraud
- Digital verification replacing National Insurance number reliance
- Remove "key pull factors" for illegal migration

## International Context

The UK government plans to adopt "best aspects" from existing systems in:

### **Established Systems**
- **[[Entity - Estonia]]**: Mandatory since 2002, covers medical records, voting, banking
- **[[Entity - Australia]]**: Optional digital ID app for government/private services  
- **[[Entity - Denmark]]**: Uses MitID digital identity and authentication app (no physical ID cards)
- **[[Entity - India]]**: Aadhaar 12-digit reference system

### **European Union Context**
- **EU Physical ID Cards**: Standard machine-readable format across 25 of 27 member states (exceptions: Denmark digital-only, Ireland passport cards)
- **EU Digital Identity Wallet**: Planned rollout by end of 2026 across all member states
- **Large-Scale Pilots**: 350+ companies and authorities across 26 member states plus Norway, Iceland, Ukraine testing systems
- **[[Entity - France]]**: France Identite app combines identity card, driving licence, and vehicle registration

### **Other Digital ID Countries**
Singapore, Greece, France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, UAE, China, Costa Rica, South Korea, Afghanistan

## Historical Context

### **Previous UK Attempts**
- **Tony Blair (2000s)**: Voluntary ID cards legislated
- **2011**: Conservative-led coalition scrapped Blair's scheme (too costly/intrusive)
- **WWII Era**: Compulsory ID cards during wartime
- **1952**: Winston Churchill scrapped post-war ID cards over cost/police use concerns

### **Current Timing**
- Follows [[Event - Switzerland Electronic ID Referendum 2025]] (narrow approval)
- Part of broader European digital identity push ([[Event - EU Digital Identity Wallet Rollout]])
- **UK Exceptionalism**: Unlike EU's optional wallet approach, UK making employment-based digital ID mandatory

### **Global Opposition Context**
Cross-party criticism mirrors international resistance patterns:
- **Conservative Party**: Demands "proper national debate"
- **Liberal Democrats**: Questions effectiveness for immigration control  
- **Reform UK**: Opposition to digital surveillance infrastructure
- **Civil Liberties**: 2.4M petition signatures demonstrate democratic resistance

## Privacy and Civil Liberties Concerns

### **Expansion Risks**
- **Mission creep**: Limited system could expand to broader surveillance
- **Data security**: Government/tech company data protection failures
- **Government overreach**: Potential for authoritarian control mechanisms

### **Ruled Out (Currently)**
- Healthcare access requirements
- Welfare payment requirements  
- Daily carrying obligations

### **Prominent Critics**
**David Davis** (Former Conservative Cabinet Minister):
- Campaigned against Blair's 2000s ID scheme
- Warns "no system is immune to failure"
- Cites repeated government/tech data protection failures

- **Facial Recognition**: Marketing materials promote image analysis and facial recognition capabilities
- **China Deployment**: Oracle marketed surveillance software to Chinese police and military clients
- **CIA Origins**: Company founded with CIA database networking project (1970s)

### **Government-Corporate Coordination**
**Peter Kyle** (former Tech Secretary):

- Industry calls for urgent clarification from OfDIA and GDS

## Implementation Timeline

- **2025-2029**: System development and rollout
