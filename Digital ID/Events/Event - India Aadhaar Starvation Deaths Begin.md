# Event: India Aadhaar Starvation Deaths Begin

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Documented starvation deaths linked to Aadhaar authentication failures in India's Public Distribution System (PDS)
- **When**: May 2017 – ongoing (initial cases documented 2017-2018)
- **Where**: Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and other Indian states
- **Who**: Aadhaar-linked ration beneficiaries, vulnerable households (Dalit, Adivasi, widows, disabled), state food supply departments
- **Why**: Biometric authentication failures and Aadhaar linkage requirements denied access to subsidized grains, pensions, and welfare benefits

## Detailed Description
Following aggressive Aadhaar seeding of ration cards and welfare schemes after the 2016 demonetization push, multiple hunger deaths were documented from 2017 onwards when beneficiaries were refused food due to biometric failures or deleted ration cards. The earliest widely reported case occurred in May 2017 when 11-year-old Santoshi Kumari of Jharkhand died after her family's ration card was deactivated for lacking Aadhaar linkage. Subsequent investigations by [[Right to Food Campaign India]] activists and journalists documented dozens of similar cases.

Common failure points included fingerprint mismatches (especially among elderly/manual laborers), server outages preventing real-time authentication, and deletion of ration cards flagged as duplicates by Aadhaar-based deduplication algorithms. Despite Supreme Court warnings, state governments continued enforcing Aadhaar-based authentication, resulting in preventable deaths.

## Participants
### Government Agencies
- **Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)**: Provides biometric authentication infrastructure
- **State Food & Civil Supplies Departments**: Implement e-POS devices requiring Aadhaar across ration shops
- **Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution**: Sets national PDS policy
- **Local administrators (Block Supply Officers)**: Enforce Aadhaar mandates at fair price shops

### Civil Society & Researchers
- [[Right to Food Campaign India]], [[Jean Drèze]], [[Reetika Khera]], [[Ankita Aggarwal]], and other activists documenting cases
- National Human Rights Commission inquiries into starvation incidents
- Media outlets: Scroll.in, The Wire, Hindustan Times, Indian Express reporting verified cases

### Affected Populations
- Dalit and Adivasi families lacking documentation
- Widows and elderly individuals with worn or unreadable fingerprints
- Migrant workers with intermittent access to ration shops
- Persons with disabilities and chronic illnesses unable to complete biometric verification

## Timeline (Select Incidents)
- **2017-05**: Santoshi Kumari (Jharkhand) dies after ration denial
- **2017-09**: Etwariya Devi (Jharkhand) dies after authentication failures for 6 months
- **2017-10**: Jharkhand reports at least three hunger deaths linked to Aadhaar-based ration denials
- **2017-12**: Ministry of Consumer Affairs acknowledges technical issues but continues rollout
- **2018-03**: Supreme Court hearings highlight starvation cases during Aadhaar constitutional challenge
- **2018-11**: Ration card deletions trigger protests in Jharkhand; state revokes 11 lakh cards

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Supreme Court (2018) mandates that no citizen should be denied rations for lack of Aadhaar, yet enforcement remains inconsistent
- Jharkhand government admits 11 lakh ration cards were cancelled due to lack of Aadhaar linkage
- National protests pressure states to relax biometric requirements, but failure-prone e-POS devices remain widespread
- Multiple states introduce offline alternatives, though implementation gaps persist

## Documentation & Evidence
- Field investigations by Right to Food Campaign and independent researchers
- Government responses to RTI (Right to Information) queries confirming ration card cancellations
- Supreme Court case filings (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India)
- Journalistic exposés: Scroll.in, The Wire, Hindustan Times, Economic and Political Weekly articles
- Academic analyses: EPW (2018) "Aadhaar and Food Security in Jharkhand," Rethink Aadhaar testimonies

## Significance
This event provides concrete evidence of how digital ID systems can directly cause loss of life when used as gatekeepers for essential services without robust safeguards. It underscores [[Finding - Systematic Biometric Exclusion of Vulnerable Populations]] and demonstrates the lethal consequences of [[Finding - Five-Phase Evolution]] when systems move from voluntary to mandatory. The deaths galvanized resistance movements and legal challenges, heavily influencing the narrative around Aadhaar's risks.

- Similar to: [[Event - Vietnam Mass Bank Account Closures]] in exclusionary impact
- Documents harm patterns cited in: [[Investigation - Digital ID Systems as Tools of Authoritarian Control]]

## Verification Status
- Primary sources: Government RTI responses, Supreme Court records (Reliability: A)
- Independent documentation: Verified case studies by Right to Food Campaign and journalists (Reliability: A)
- Academic research: EPW, Oxford scholars (Reliability: B)
