# Event: India Demonetization Push

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Sudden withdrawal of ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes (86% of cash in circulation) combined with aggressive digital identity linkage mandates
- **When**: Announced 8 November 2016; cash withdrawal phased between 9 November 2016 and 30 December 2016
- **Where**: Republic of India (nationwide)
- **Who**: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Government of India, Reserve Bank of India, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), digital payment companies
- **Why**: Officially to combat black money, counterfeit currency, and terrorism financing; practically used to accelerate Aadhaar-linked digital payments and surveillance

## Detailed Description
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced late on 8 November 2016 that all ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes would cease being legal tender effective midnight, shock-deleting 86% of the nation's cash supply. Citizens were required to deposit withdrawn notes in bank accounts, subjecting transactions to Aadhaar-based Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Government initiatives promoted cashless transactions through Aadhaar-enabled Payment Systems (AePS), Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and biometric point-of-sale devices.

The policy forced hundreds of millions into banks and digital platforms, providing a unique opportunity to expand digital ID capture and financial surveillance. Public distribution system (PDS) benefits, pensions, and mobile SIM connections increasingly demanded Aadhaar linkage. The move also accelerated seeding of Aadhaar into bank accounts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) rules.

## Participants
### Government Authorities
- **Government of India**: Policy architect; Ministry of Finance and Cabinet Secretariat executed implementation
- **Reserve Bank of India**: Issued demonetization notifications and cash exchange rules
- **Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)**: Supplied Aadhaar authentication infrastructure for banking and welfare
- **National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)**: Expanded UPI and AePS services

- Digital wallet companies ([[Paytm]], [[MobiKwik]]) incentivized with subsidies and promotional campaigns
- Banks and microfinance institutions adopting Aadhaar e-KYC for account opening
- Telecommunications providers enforcing SIM-Aadhaar linkage for mobile payments

### Affected Populations
- 1.3 billion citizens forced into cash exchange queues
- Informal sector workers (90% of workforce) facing wage disruption
- Rural households lacking banking access forced to adopt biometrics

## Timeline
- **2016-11-08 20:00**: National broadcast announcing demonetization
- **2016-11-09**: Banks and ATMs closed; new ₹2,000 notes introduced
- **2016-11-14**: Withdrawal limits revised; biometric AePS promoted at ration shops
- **2016-11-28**: Government launches Aadhaar Payment Bridge and BHIM app promotion
- **2016-12-30**: Deadline for depositing old notes; ongoing Aadhaar seeding continues into 2017

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Aadhaar enrollment surged from ~1.05 billion (Oct 2016) to 1.15 billion (Mar 2017)
- Bank account-Aadhaar linkage mandated under PMLA (later challenged in Supreme Court)
- Sparked widespread economic disruption: GDP growth dipped from 8% to 6.1% (Q1 2017)
- Pushed informal economy into formal banking networks controlled via digital identity

## Documentation & Evidence
- Government Gazette notifications (S.O. 3407(E) and S.O. 3408(E))
- RBI Annual Report 2016-2017 and demonetization review studies
- UIDAI and NPCI data on Aadhaar-linked transactions
- Academic analyses: Jean Drèze & R. Khera (EPW), IMF working papers

## Significance
The demonetization push exemplifies crisis-driven acceleration of digital identity systems. By weaponizing financial shock, the government compelled Aadhaar enrollment, normalized biometric payments, and established the infrastructure later used for targeted exclusion (e.g., ration denials). It is core evidence in [[Finding - Crisis Events Systematically Exploited for Digital ID Expansion]] and [[Finding - Five-Phase Evolution]].
