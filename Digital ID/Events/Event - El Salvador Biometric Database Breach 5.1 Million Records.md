# Event: El Salvador Biometric Database Breach 5.1 Million Records

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Massive breach of El Salvador's national biometric database exposing facial images and identity details for approximately 5.1 million citizens (80% of population).
- **When**: Disclosed April 24, 2024 after data appeared on dark web forums.
- **Where**: San Salvador (national ID infrastructure).
- **Who**: Government of El Salvador, Ministry of Justice and Public Security, digital ID vendor consortium.
- **Why**: Inadequate security controls and misconfigured cloud storage allowed attackers to exfiltrate high-resolution biometric data and linked identity numbers.

## Detailed Description
Cybersecurity researchers discovered a 4TB dataset containing high-definition facial photos, national ID numbers (Documento Único de Identidad, DUI), addresses, and personal details. The breach stemmed from an improperly secured S3-compatible storage bucket used for the country's biometric ID program. Threat actors offered the dataset for sale and shared samples publicly, triggering concerns about identity theft and irreversible biometric compromise.

The government confirmed the incident and launched an investigation, temporarily suspending biometric enrollment. Civil society organizations demanded transparency and legal safeguards.

## Impact
- 5.1 million biometric records (80% of El Salvador's population).
- Potential for deepfake-enabled fraud, credential spoofing, and regional identity black market activity.
- Undermined trust in the government's digital transformation initiatives.

## Responses
- Government announced forensic probe and pledged to enhance security.
- International digital rights groups called for independent audits and compensation plans.
- U.S. and regional financial institutions raised alerts over possible identity fraud.

## Sources
- Biometric Update (April 24, 2024).
- Investigative reports by cybersecurity firms (Sumsub, Entrust).
- Salvadoran press (La Prensa Gráfica, El Diario de Hoy).

## Significance
Highlights the systemic risks of centralized biometric databases without robust security. Cited in [[Finding - Biometric Security Vulnerability Systemic Failures]] and [[Investigation - Digital ID Acceleration and Corporate Consolidation]].

## Related Events
- Connected to: [[Event - National Public Data Breach 2.9 Billion Records]].
- Raises concerns mirrored in [[Finding - Systematic Biometric Exclusion of Vulnerable Populations]] (permanent compromise).

## Verification Status
- Primary reporting: Biometric Update (Reliability: B).
- Confirmation via government statements and security firm analyses (Reliability: B).
