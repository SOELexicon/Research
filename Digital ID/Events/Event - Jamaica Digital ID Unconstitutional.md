# Event: Jamaica Digital ID Unconstitutional

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Supreme Court of Jamaica strikes down the National Identification and Registration Act (NIDS) and declares the digital ID scheme unconstitutional
- **When**: 12 January 2024 (final ruling)
- **Where**: Supreme Court, Kingston, Jamaica
- **Who**: Chief Justice Bryan Sykes, claimant Julian Robinson (opposition MP), Government of Jamaica, civil society organizations
- **Why**: Court found the law violated constitutional rights to privacy, due process, and protection against unreasonable search, and created disproportionate surveillance risks

## Detailed Description
The National Identification System (NIDS) aimed to create a mandatory biometric database requiring all Jamaicans to provide fingerprints, facial images, and demographic data to access public services. Opposition MP Julian Robinson and civil society groups challenged the law, arguing it lacked sufficient safeguards. Chief Justice Bryan Sykes ruled large portions of the law unconstitutional, citing intrusive data collection, broad powers for warrantless search, and punitive measures for non-enrollment.

Key findings included:
- Mandatory enrollment constituted a disproportionate invasion of privacy
- Collection of biometric information without adequate safeguards breached constitutional protections
- Penalties for non-compliance (including imprisonment) were excessive
- Warrantless search provisions violated constitutional guarantees

### Respondents

- **2019-04**: Court issues interim ruling striking down select provisions

- **2024-01-12**: Final judgment declares the Act unconstitutional in its entirety

## Outcomes & Decisions
