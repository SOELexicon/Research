# Event: Canada Population Growth Policy Reversal 2024

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Dramatic reversal of immigration policy to reduce non-permanent residents (NPRs)
- **When**: Throughout 2024
- **Where**: [[Entity - Canada]]
- **Who**: [[Entity - Justin Trudeau]] government, [[Entity - Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]]
- **Why**: Response to housing crisis and public backlash over rapid population growth

## Detailed Description
In 2024, the Canadian federal government executed a sharp policy reversal to address the unprecedented strain on housing and public services caused by the massive influx of non-permanent residents. After encouraging rapid immigration growth through 2022-2023 to address post-pandemic labour shortages, the government implemented a series of measures designed to significantly reduce the number of temporary residents in response to widespread public backlash over housing unaffordability.

The policy changes included tighter rules on work and study permits, specifically targeting international students and temporary foreign workers who had driven the population boom. By 2023, temporary residents constituted 6.2% of the country's population (around 2.5 million people), reaching a peak of 7.6% by October 2024 before the policy changes took effect.

## Participants
### Government Officials
- [[Entity - Justin Trudeau]] - Prime Minister overseeing policy reversal
- [[Entity - Marc Miller]] - Immigration Minister implementing changes
- [[Entity - Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] - Federal department executing policy

### Affected Groups
- International students facing tighter permit restrictions
- Temporary foreign workers subject to new limitations
- Provincial governments dealing with housing pressure

## Timeline
- **2022-2023**: Peak immigration surge to address labour shortages
- **Early 2024**: Public backlash over housing costs reaches critical levels
- **Mid-2024**: Government introduces tighter work and study permit rules
- **October 2024**: NPR population peaks at 7.6% of total population
- **Q4 2024**: Policy changes begin showing measurable impact

## Outcomes & Decisions
- **Immediate Impact**: Sharp decline in NPR population growth
- **Housing Market**: Beginning of cooling in some segments, particularly Toronto condos
- **Labour Market**: Emergence of new labour shortages in sectors reliant on temporary workers
- **Population Target**: Federal goal to reduce NPR share to 5% by end of 2026

## Documentation & Evidence
- [[Research - Canada's Population, Government, Digital ID]] - Primary analysis source
- Statistics Canada quarterly population estimates
- Immigration policy announcements from IRCC

## Significance
This policy reversal represents a critical shift from Canada's post-pandemic growth strategy to a contraction model aimed at addressing domestic political pressures. The "policy whiplash" demonstrates the government's prioritization of housing affordability over economic growth targets, but created new economic vulnerabilities including resumed population aging and sector-specific labour shortages.

The reversal was directly linked to the political crisis that would ultimately lead to [[Event - Trudeau Resignation Liberal Leadership Crisis 2025]], as the housing crisis became the dominant political issue driving voter dissatisfaction.
