# Event - China Digital Yuan 7 Trillion Yuan Processing Milestone

## Quick Facts
- **What**: China's Digital Yuan (e-CNY) reaching 7 trillion yuan ($986 billion) total transaction volume
- **When**: June 2024
- **Where**: [[Entity - China]] - Nationwide digital currency system
- **Who**: [[Entity - People's Bank of China]], Chinese government, 261+ million users
- **Why**: Demonstration of successful large-scale CBDC implementation with comprehensive surveillance capabilities

## Detailed Description
China's Digital Yuan (e-CNY) achieved a critical milestone in June 2024 by reaching 7 trillion yuan (approximately $986 billion) in total transaction processing, representing a nearly fourfold increase from the previous year. This achievement demonstrates the successful implementation of the world's most advanced Central Bank Digital Currency with integrated surveillance and social control capabilities, validating the feasibility of comprehensive financial monitoring and behavioral modification through programmable money.

The milestone represents not merely a technical achievement in digital payment processing, but the successful deployment of a comprehensive population control system disguised as financial innovation. The e-CNY system now processes more financial transactions than many national economies, providing the Chinese government with unprecedented real-time visibility into citizen behavior and the capability to implement automated social engineering through financial incentives and restrictions.
