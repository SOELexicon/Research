# Event: UK ID Card Cancellation 2010

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Repeal of the UK Identity Cards Act 2006 and destruction of the National Identity Register
- **When**: Identity Documents Bill introduced 27 May 2010; Royal Assent granted 21 December 2010
- **Where**: United Kingdom (Westminster Parliament and National Identity Register facility in Merseyside)
- **Who**: Coalition Government (Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties), Home Secretary Theresa May, Deputy PM Nick Clegg, UK Home Office, Identity and Passport Service
- **Why**: Fulfill election pledge to scrap the Labour government's ID card scheme viewed as intrusive, costly, and ineffective

## Detailed Description
The incoming Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government prioritized dismantling the ID card program introduced by the previous Labour administration. The Identity Documents Bill (IDB) was presented to Parliament on 27 May 2010, repealing the Identity Cards Act 2006. The bill mandated cancellation of all existing ID cards, refunds for cardholders, and immediate destruction of biometric and demographic data stored in the National Identity Register (NIR).

On 21 December 2010, after expedited parliamentary debate, the Identity Documents Act 2010 received Royal Assent. Physical destruction of the NIR involved shredding, incineration, and wiping of backup systems, overseen by the Home Office and independent auditors. Approximately £86 million was saved in future operating costs, avoiding an estimated £800 million in lifetime maintenance expenses. The repeal restored pre-existing passport and driving license identification paths without centralized biometric tracking.

## Participants
### Government Leaders
- **Prime Minister David Cameron** and **Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg**: Coalition leaders championing repeal
- **Home Secretary Theresa May**: Introduced legislation and supervised register destruction
- **Minister of State for Immigration Damian Green**: Oversaw decommissioning of ID card infrastructure

### Opposition & Stakeholders
- Civil liberties organizations (Liberty, NO2ID, Privacy International) applauded repeal
- Labour Party defended original scheme but could not block legislation
- Identity and Passport Service staff conducted decommissioning procedures

## Timeline
- **2010-05-27**: Identity Documents Bill introduced in House of Commons
- **2010-07**: Bill passes Commons; scrutiny in House of Lords
- **2010-11-22**: Final parliamentary approval
- **2010-12-21**: Royal Assent; Identity Documents Act 2010 enacted
- **2011-02**: National Identity Register physically destroyed; final report issued

## Outcomes & Decisions
- Legal repeal of ID card requirements and data retention
- Destruction of biometric database, establishing precedent for decommissioning intrusive systems
- Affirmed UK's commitment to privacy and limited government data collection
- Provided case study of successful civil liberties campaign against digital ID expansion

## Documentation & Evidence
- Identity Documents Act 2010 (UK legislation)
- Home Office statements and final decommissioning report (February 2011)
- Parliamentary debates (Hansard) and committee reports
- Press coverage: BBC, The Guardian, Financial Times

## Significance
This event remains a landmark example of democratic rollback of a digital identity program. It proves large-scale biometric registries can be dismantled through political will, supporting [[Finding - Legal Resistance Success Patterns 2024-2025]]. The destruction of the NIR is frequently cited by opponents of new ID schemes, including the 2025 "BritCard" proposal referenced in [[Investigation - Digital ID Acceleration and Corporate Consolidation]].
