# Event - Project mBridge Minimum Viable Product Launch

## Quick Facts
- **What**: Project mBridge multi-CBDC platform achieving operational minimum viable product status
- **When**: September 2024 (estimated)
- **Where**: Multiple participating jurisdictions coordinated through BIS Innovation Hub
- **Who**: Five central banks (China, Hong Kong, Thailand, UAE, Saudi Arabia) coordinated by BIS
- **Why**: Operational alternative to SWIFT for cross-border payments and comprehensive financial surveillance

## Detailed Description
Project mBridge reached minimum viable product status in 2024, marking the transition from pilot testing to operational capability for the world's first comprehensive multi-CBDC cross-border payment platform. This milestone represents the successful implementation of a parallel international financial infrastructure that enables real-time state-level surveillance while simultaneously providing sanctions evasion capabilities for participating countries.

The platform's achievement of operational status demonstrates the feasibility of bypassing the Western-controlled SWIFT messaging system through direct central bank coordination, creating an alternative financial architecture that challenges existing international monetary arrangements while enabling unprecedented cross-border surveillance coordination among authoritarian regimes.

## Participants
### Central Bank Coordination
