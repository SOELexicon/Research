## Timeline

### July 15, 2024
**GMC Issues Decision Letter**
- Reference: E1-4418967221
- Declined to investigate Mark Sexton's complaint about TV doctors
- Doctors named: Dr Hilary Jones, Dr Ranjit Singh, Dr Sarah Jarvis
- Referred complainant to Ofcom and MHRA
- Offered Rule 12 internal review option

### July 16, 2024
**Mark Sexton Requests Rule 12 Review**
- Posted announcement on Facebook stating GMC gave right to review
- Submitted extensive Rule 12 review request
- Posted full review request text in public interest
- Stated: "Let's see how they deal with this?"

## Complaint Details

### Original Allegations
1. TV doctors expressing public support for COVID-19 vaccines while receiving pharmaceutical payments
2. Conflict of interest - placing monetary gain ahead of patient safety
3. Administering vaccines knowing they are not safe
4. Making baseless, misleading, and potentially criminal claims vaccines are "100% safe and effective"
5. Lying to and misleading the public
6. Promoting dangerous products

### GMC's Initial Decision Rationale
- No evidence doctors deliberately lied or misled public
- Opinions on vaccinations not contrary to public health advice at time
- Opinions would be supported by reasonable body of medical practitioners
- No information suggesting payments influenced treatment of own patients
- Issues do not call into question fitness to practise

## Rule 12 Review Request Grounds

### 1. Public Protection
- 250,000+ excess deaths since vaccine rollout
- Millions of men, women, and children injured
- Figures increasing daily

### 2. Legal Protection for Doctors
- Doctors not providing informed consent per Montgomery v Lanarkshire 2015
- Potential Gross Negligent Manslaughter liability
- 380,000 registered doctors potentially at risk

### 3. Evidence Previously Ignored
- Pfizer government contracts admitting unknown long-term effects
- Pharmaceutical industry conflicts of interest
- Alternative treatments suppressed

### 4. New Evidence Submitted

**Dr Francis Boyle Affidavit:**
- Harvard law professor who drafted 1989 Biological Weapons Act
- Sworn statement: COVID-19 mRNA injections are bioweapons/WMD
- Asserts injections violate bioweapons laws
- Characterizes vaccination as state terrorism
- Source: https://francisaboyle.substack.com

**The Hope Accord:**
- Calls for immediate suspension of COVID-19 vaccines
- Recognition and support for vaccine injured
- Full re-evaluation of COVID-19 products
- Renewed commitment to ethical medicine principles
- **Signatories (41,221 total):**
  - 1,283 Medical Doctors
  - 3,474 Other Healthcare Professionals
  - 1,369 Scientists & Academics
  - 35,095 Concerned Citizens
- Source: https://thehopeaccord.org/

**Additional Evidence:**
- Pfizer admission vaccines never tested for transmission (European Parliament)
- Kansas Attorney General suing Pfizer for lying about vaccine safety
- Lancet peer-reviewed paper: 325 autopsies, 74% deaths caused by vaccines
- WHO served with liability notice by doctors and lawyers
- Pfizer found guilty of promoting unlicensed vaccines
- Dr Aseem Malhotra testimony under oath in Helsinki courts
- Nuremberg codes and Declaration of Helsinki breaches

### 5. Public Interest
- Direct impact on public health and safety
- Systemic failure in medical regulation
- Informed consent violations affecting millions

## Key Legal and Ethical Arguments

### Informed Consent Requirements (Montgomery v Lanarkshire)
Doctors MUST disclose before vaccination:
1. New vaccine type never used on humans (animal trial deaths)
2. Long-term safety unknown
3. Efficacy unknown
4. Many expected side-effects, not all known
5. Over 1,000 possible side-effects listed by manufacturer
6. Serious harm and injury might occur
7. Death might occur
8. Recipient participating in 3-year medical trial
9. Manufacturer has full legal indemnity
10. Manufacturer withheld trial data on cancer and heart attacks
11. Government withheld alternative safe treatments
12. Vaccines licensed under emergency use only (fraudulently, as alternatives existed)

### GMC Institutional Failures
1. **Abdication of Responsibility:** Referring to MHRA and Ofcom instead of acting
2. **Failure to Notify Doctors:** Not providing critical information to 380,000 registered members
3. **Potential Criminal Liability:** Corporate Manslaughter, Misconduct/Misfeasance in public office
4. **Insurance Implications:** Public liability policies may be void
5. **Breach of Contract:** Failing duty to paid members (Â£455 annual fee = multi-millions revenue)
6. **Double Standard:** Investigating doctors who challenged narrative, not investigating doctors with pharma conflicts

### Comparison to Historical Scandals
- **Post Office Scandal:** Decades of lies, cover-ups, wrongful imprisonment
- **Contaminated Blood Scandal:** Decades of denial, victims denied justice
- **COVID-19 Vaccines:** Cannot afford to wait decades for accountability

### Political Context
- Prime Minister Rishi Sunak dropped "effective" from vaccine description in Parliament
- Only stated vaccines were "safe" (not "safe and effective")
- Suggests official acknowledgment vaccines not effective

## Offer to GMC
Mark Sexton offered to facilitate round-table meeting with independent experts:
- Medical experts
- Scientific experts
- Legal experts
- Data analysts
- Funeral directors
- Retired and serving police
- MPs
- Journalists

Purpose: Provide GMC with "vast amount of irrefutable and damning evidence"

## Outcome
Awaiting GMC response to Rule 12 review request.

## Significance

### Regulatory Accountability
- Tests GMC's willingness to reconsider decisions based on new evidence
- Challenges GMC's deference to government/pharmaceutical narrative
- Exposes potential regulatory capture

### Medical Ethics
- Highlights informed consent violations
- Questions doctor independence from industry influence
- Raises patient safety vs. policy compliance conflict

### Public Interest
- Documents systematic failure in medical oversight
- Parallels to other major UK scandals (Post Office, Contaminated Blood)
- Represents grassroots resistance to institutional capture
