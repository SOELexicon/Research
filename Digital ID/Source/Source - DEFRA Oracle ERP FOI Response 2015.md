# Source - DEFRA FOI: Oracle ERP Provision (RFI 7116)

## Document Details
- **Reference**: RFI 7116
- **Date**: 9 January 2015
- **Subject**: Oracle E‑Business Suite / ERP provision at DEFRA
- **Handled under**: Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA)

## Key Disclosures
- **ERP Platform**: DEFRA confirms use of Oracle (E‑Business Suite)
- **Support Model**: No separate Oracle support partner; support provided via existing contracts with **IBM** and **Shared Services Connected Ltd (SSCL)**
- **Tender Portal**: **Bravo Solutions** used for tendering
- **Prior Publication**: DEFRA points to prior publication of financial/HR/IT systems overview (Section 21 FOIA – information reasonably accessible)

## Withheld Information and Exemptions
- **Withheld**: Details of “Oracle elements used” (Q9)
- **Exemptions Cited**:
  - **Section 24 (National Security)**: Releasing component details could assist attacks on systems
  - **Section 31(1)(a) (Prevention of Crime)**: Disclosure would prejudice crime prevention (facilitate hacking)
- **Public Interest Test**: Balance favors withholding due to security risk despite general transparency interest

## Intelligence Assessment
- Demonstrates long‑standing Oracle ERP deployment in central government and the **shared services** support model (IBM/SSCL)
- Establishes a **security‑based FOI withholding pattern** (national security/crime prevention) distinct from commercial prejudice, widening the rationale governments use to limit Oracle system transparency
- Confirms **procurement channel** (Bravo Solutions), useful for tracking historic tenders and contract lineage

## Connections
- **Corporate Capture/Transparency**: Supports findings on selective transparency and FOI resistance in Oracle government deployments
- **Shared Services Ecosystem**: Highlights SSCL’s role in Oracle ERP support across Whitehall
