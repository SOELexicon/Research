# Research - Mark Sexton COVID-19 Accountability Campaign 2021-2024

## Executive Summary

Mark Sexton, a former UK police constable, has conducted a systematic multi-year, multi-venue legal accountability campaign targeting the UK Government's COVID-19 response policies. From December 2021 through July 2024, Sexton pursued accountability through criminal complaints, judicial reviews, medical regulation complaints, and preparation for International Criminal Court application. His campaign demonstrates a pattern of UK institutional unwillingness to investigate alleged crimes against humanity related to COVID-19 policies, particularly vaccine-related harms and elderly care deaths.

## Pattern Analysis: Institutional Unwillingness

### Three-Tier Rejection Pattern

#### Level 1: Executive Branch (Metropolitan Police)
**Pattern:**
- Initial appearance of engagement (officers allocated, superintendent aware)
- Quick closure without genuine investigation (2 months)
- Refusal to investigate government crimes
- **Interpretation:** Executive protecting executive

#### Level 2: Judicial Branch (High Court)
**Pattern:**
- Refused to review police closure
- Protected police from accountability oversight
- Dismissed without detailed reasoning
- **Interpretation:** Judiciary protecting executive

#### Level 3: Appellate Court (Court of Appeal)
**Pattern:**
- Refused to overturn judicial protection
- Final domestic barrier to accountability
- Systematic institutional alignment
- **Interpretation:** Complete institutional capture

### Regulatory Capture Pattern

#### Medical Regulation (GMC)
**Pattern:**
- TV doctors (pharma-funded, pro-vaccine): Protected
- Independent doctors (no pharma funding, vaccine skeptics): Investigated
- Regulatory body aligning with industry/government interests
- Patient safety subordinated to policy compliance

#### Drug Regulation (MHRA)
**Named Defendant:** Crime Number 01/62447/24
**Pattern:**
- Authorized vaccines despite unknown long-term effects
- Misrepresented safety to public
- Suppressed adverse event data
- Regulatory failure enabling pharmaceutical industry

### Media Blackout Pattern

#### Mainstream Media
- Poor coverage of accountability efforts
- Scottish Inquiry testimonies ignored
- GMC double standard not reported
- Systematic suppression of evidence

#### Alternative Media
- Largely silent (except TNT Radio)
- "So-called alternative media" also ignoring
- Controlled opposition theory supported
- Citizen journalism filling gap (biologyphenom, Mark Sexton)

#### Parliamentary Silence
- MSPs (Members of Scottish Parliament) silent on inquiry
- MPs largely silent on accountability demands
- Exception: Andrew Bridgen MP supporting Sexton

### Historical Parallels

#### UK Institutional Cover-Up Precedents

**Post Office Horizon Scandal:**
- Decades of institutional lies
- Hundreds wrongly prosecuted
- Courts sided with institution
- Victims waited decades for justice

**Contaminated Blood Scandal:**
- Decades of NHS denial
- Thousands killed by healthcare system
- Systematic cover-up
- 40+ years before accountability

**COVID-19 Accountability:**
- Emerging pattern: systematic rejection
- Institutional protection at all levels
- Likely decades of denial ahead
- Justifies international intervention (ICC)

## Evidence Base

### Vaccine Safety and Efficacy

#### Pfizer Government Contracts
**Contract Language (South Africa, Brazil, Albania, Canada, EU):**
> "The purchaser acknowledges that the long term effects and efficacy of the vaccines are not currently known and that there may be adverse effects of the vaccines that are not currently known."

**Implications:**
- "Safe and effective" claims fraudulent
- Governments signed contracts knowing risks unknown
- Public misled about safety and efficacy
- Legal basis for fraud charges

#### Pfizer Admissions
1. **European Parliament (Rob Roos):** Never tested for transmission
2. **Trial Data:** Over 1,000 possible side-effects listed
3. **Withheld Data:** Cancer and heart attack prevalence suppressed
4. **Legal Indemnity:** No liability for injuries or deaths

#### Expert Testimony
**Dr Francis Boyle (Harvard Law Professor, Bioweapons Expert):**
- Drafted 1989 Biological Weapons and Antiterrorism Act
- Signed affidavit: mRNA injections are bioweapons/WMD
- Asserts injections violate bioweapons laws
- Characterizes vaccination as state terrorism

#### Medical Professional Consensus
**The Hope Accord (as of July 2024):**
- Total Signatories: 41,221
- Medical Doctors: 1,283
- Other Healthcare Professionals: 3,474
- Scientists & Academics: 1,369
- Concerned Citizens: 35,095

**Calls for:**
- Immediate suspension of COVID-19 vaccines
- Recognition and support for vaccine-injured
- Full re-evaluation of COVID-19 products
- Renewed commitment to ethical medicine

#### Legal Actions Worldwide
- Kansas Attorney General suing Pfizer for lying about safety
- Liability notice served on WHO in Geneva by doctors/lawyers
- Pfizer found guilty of promoting unlicensed vaccines

### Informed Consent Violations

#### Montgomery v Lanarkshire 2015 Standard
**Legal Requirements Before Vaccination:**
1. Experimental nature of mRNA vaccines
2. Long-term safety unknown
3. Efficacy unknown
4. Many expected side-effects, not all known
5. Over 1,000 possible side-effects
6. Serious harm and injury might occur
7. Death might occur
8. Recipient participating in 3-year medical trial
9. Manufacturer has full legal indemnity
10. Manufacturer withheld trial data on cancer/heart attacks
11. Government withheld alternative safe treatments
12. Vaccines licensed under fraudulent emergency use

**Sexton's GMC Argument:**
> "If all doctors registered with the GMC did not give informed consent, administered the vaccine and the recipient died from the vaccine, that doctor is guilty, in law of Gross Negligent Manslaughter because they failed in their duty of care."

### Elderly Care Deaths

#### Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry Evidence
**Shelagh McCall KC Summary:**
- Physical and mental health deterioration "NOTHING to do with COVID-19"
- Suspected neglect, dehydration, starvation
- Forged DNR signatures
- Missing medical records
- Human rights violations
- Power of attorney ignored

**Mechanism of Death (Testimony Analysis):**
1. Elderly isolated from family oversight
2. Neglect causes distress and anxiety
3. Distress managed with end-of-life sedation (not proper care)
4. Sedation + food/water deprivation = death
5. Death certified as "COVID-19" despite non-viral causation

**Historical Parallel:**
- Nazi T4 Euthanasia Program (1939-1945)
- 70,000-275,000 disabled/elderly killed
- Medical facilities used for killing
- Forged death certificates
- Families denied access
- "Mercy killing" justification

#### Lancet Peer-Reviewed Paper
- 325 autopsies conducted in Germany
- 74% proved death caused by vaccines
- Not COVID-19 as officially certified
- Systematic misattribution of cause of death

### Death and Injury Statistics

#### UK Excess Deaths
- 250,000+ excess deaths since vaccine rollout
- Figures increasing daily
- Cannot be hidden or ignored any longer
- Used as basis for crimes against humanity charges

#### Vaccine Injuries
- Millions of men, women, and children injured
- Lois Bayliss received "large number of emails from those damaged"
- Mass mobilization to Crime Number 01/62447/24
- Individual assault complaints strategy

## Strategic Innovations

### Mass Complaint Strategy (Crime Number 01/62447/24)

#### Individual Assault Complaints
**Innovation:** Transform systemic issue into mass individual criminal cases

**Mechanism:**
1. Each vaccine-injured person files own assault complaint
2. Fraud basis: Lack of informed consent
3. Injury = assault under Offences Against the Person Act 1861
4. Add details to Crime Reference Number 01/62447/24

**Advantages:**
- Potentially thousands of separate criminal cases
- Each victim becomes individual complainant
- Overwhelms police capacity to dismiss
- Not single political complaint, but mass criminal accountability
- Harder to close en masse than single case

### Named Defendants Strategy

#### Shift from General to Specific Accountability

**Original Complaint (6029679/21):**
- General: "UK Government COVID-19 response"
- Easier to dismiss as political

**New Complaint (01/62447/24):**
- Specific: Sir Graham Brady MP, Dame June Raine, MHRA, Pfizer, UK Government
- Individual accountability
- Personal liability established
- Corporate liability established
- Harder to protect specific individuals than general government

### Parliamentary Pressure

#### Andrew Bridgen MP Involvement
**Action:** Two-page letter requesting urgent meeting with Sir Mark Rowley (Metropolitan Police Commissioner)

**Advantages:**
- Parliamentary backing for criminal investigation
- Political pressure on police
- Elevates from citizen complaint to MP intervention
- Creates public record of parliamentary concern
- Institutional credibility added

### MI5/Security Services Engagement

#### Terrorism Framework
**Innovation:** Characterize COVID-19 response as domestic terrorism

**Legal Basis:**
- Terrorism Act 2000
- State actors can commit terrorism
- Mass casualties from government policy
- Political objectives through violence/harm

**MI5 Contact (March 20, 2024):**
- Security services took allegations seriously enough to contact Sexton
- Terrorism offences identified
- National security implications recognized
- Escalation beyond standard criminal complaint

### Transparency and Public Mobilization

#### Social Media Strategy
**Platform:** Facebook (primary), alternative media (BitChute, Rumble)

**Tactics:**
- Recorded calls made public "in public interest"
- Step-by-step legal instructions for public
- Crime numbers shared for mass participation
- Regular updates on legal progress
- Mobilization of grassroots actions

**Grassroots Actions Encouraged:**
- Emailing authorities
- Calling officials
- Serving notices and liability orders
- Yellow board campaigns
- Leaflet drops
- Stand in the Park (SITP)
- Outreach
- Petitions
- Protests

### ICC Preparation from Beginning

#### Strategic Anticipation (December 2021)
**Sexton's Team Statement:**
> "The Met Police have a duty to carry out a full and competent criminal investigation as detailed in the ICC's guidelines."

**Implications:**
- Anticipated UK institutional failure from day one
- Systematic documentation of each rejection level
- Building case for ICC "unwillingness" criteria
- Planned international accountability trajectory
- Domestic complaints as stepping stones to ICC

- National security implications

## Significance and Implications

### UK Institutional Unwillingness Demonstrated

#### Rome Statute Article 17 Criteria Met
**Evidence of "Unwillingness" to Prosecute:**

1. **Shielding from Criminal Responsibility (Article 17(2)(a)):**
   - Met Police closed case without investigation
   - High Court refused to review closure
   - Court of Appeal upheld protection
   - Pattern suggests shielding officials

2. **Unjustified Delay (Article 17(2)(b)):**
   - Case closed within 2 months (no investigation time)
   - Judicial review delayed 5+ months before dismissal
   - Appeal took 4 months before dismissal
   - Over 2 years with no progress toward justice

3. **Lack of Independence/Impartiality (Article 17(2)(c)):**
   - Government agencies refusing to investigate government
   - Courts refusing to hold government accountable
   - No independence from state interests
   - Systematic protection inconsistent with justice

### ICC Pathway Opened

#### Domestic Remedies Exhausted
- ✅ Criminal complaint to police (Met Police CRN 6029679/21)
- ✅ Judicial review of police decision (High Court)
- ✅ Appeal of judicial review (Court of Appeal)
- ✅ No further domestic remedies available

#### Next Steps for ICC Application
1. Prepare Article 15 communication to ICC Prosecutor
2. Submit evidence of alleged crimes (comprehensive documentation compiled)
3. Submit evidence of domestic remedy exhaustion (documented)
4. Request preliminary examination
5. ICC Prosecutor assesses gravity, jurisdiction, admissibility
6. Potential formal investigation authorization

### Global COVID-19 Accountability Precedent

#### First Systematic ICC Attempt
- First known systematic attempt to bring COVID-19 policy crimes to ICC
- Establishes model for other countries' victims
- Demonstrates domestic institutional capture globally
- International accountability when national justice fails

#### Potential Global Implications
If ICC accepts jurisdiction:
- Other countries' COVID-19 policies potentially reviewable
- International standard for pandemic response accountability
- Protection against future state abuse under health emergency powers
- Precedent for crimes against humanity in medical context
- Warning to governments worldwide

### Pattern Recognition for Future Emergencies

#### Institutional Capture Indicators
1. **Initial Appearance of Engagement:** Officers allocated, acknowledgments received
2. **Quick Closure Without Investigation:** 2-month timeline insufficient
3. **Judicial Deference to Executive:** Courts protecting government
4. **Regulatory Capture:** GMC protecting pharmaceutical interests
5. **Media Blackout:** Mainstream and alternative media silence
6. **Political Silence:** Parliamentary unwillingness to intervene

#### Citizen Response Requirements
1. **Multi-Venue Pursuit:** No single institution sufficient
2. **International Accountability:** Domestic capture requires external intervention
3. **Documentation:** Systematic evidence preservation critical
4. **Transparency:** Public communication maintains pressure
5. **Persistence:** Multi-year campaigns necessary
6. **Mass Mobilization:** Grassroots actions essential

### Medical Ethics Implications

#### Informed Consent Crisis
- Montgomery v Lanarkshire systematically violated
- 380,000 GMC-registered doctors potentially non-compliant
- Gross Negligent Manslaughter liability if deaths result
- Fundamental medical ethics abandoned during emergency

#### Regulatory Capture Exposed
- GMC protecting pharmaceutical interests over patient safety
- Double standard: industry-aligned doctors protected, independents investigated
- MHRA regulatory failure enabling pharmaceutical industry
- Patient safety subordinated to policy compliance

#### Professional Integrity Crisis
- Doctors who honored Hippocratic oath were punished
- Doctors who followed government/industry were protected
- Independent medical judgment criminalized
- Profession subordinated to state/corporate interests

### Democratic Governance Implications

#### Rule of Law Failure
- Three branches of government aligned to protect state interests
- No institutional checks and balances functioning
- Citizens denied access to justice
- Legal system structurally captured

#### Emergency Powers Abuse
- Health emergency used to justify rights violations
- No accountability for emergency power misuse
- Precedent set for future emergencies
- Democratic safeguards proven ineffective

#### International Oversight Necessity
- Domestic institutions cannot police themselves
- International accountability mechanisms required
- ICC as last resort for victims of state crimes
- Global governance implications

## Conclusion

Mark Sexton's COVID-19 accountability campaign (December 2021 - present) represents a comprehensive, persistent, multi-venue legal pursuit of accountability for alleged crimes against humanity related to the UK Government's COVID-19 response. His systematic approach has documented UK institutional unwillingness to investigate at every domestic level (police, courts, regulators), satisfying International Criminal Court admissibility requirements and opening the pathway for international prosecution.

The campaign demonstrates several critical patterns:

1. **Institutional Capture:** All three branches of UK government (executive, judicial, regulatory) aligned to protect state interests over public accountability
2. **Strategic Legal Planning:** ICC application prepared from beginning, anticipating domestic failure
3. **Evidence-Based Approach:** Comprehensive documentation including Pfizer contracts, expert testimony, victim statements, inquiry evidence
4. **Grassroots Mobilization:** Mass public engagement, multi-tactic resistance, sustained pressure over years
5. **Innovation:** Mass assault complaint strategy, named defendant approach, security services engagement

Sexton's work establishes a precedent for COVID-19 accountability pursuit globally, demonstrates the necessity of international oversight when domestic institutions are captured, and provides a model for citizen-led accountability campaigns in the face of systematic institutional resistance. The ultimate outcome—whether ICC prosecution occurs or domestic institutions eventually act—will have significant implications for pandemic response accountability, medical ethics, democratic governance, and the rule of law in health emergencies.

As of July 2024, the campaign continues with GMC Rule 12 review pending, Crime Number 01/62447/24 active, and ICC application preparation complete following exhaustion of all domestic remedies.
