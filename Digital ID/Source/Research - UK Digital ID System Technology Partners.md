# **The UK Digital Identity Ecosystem: An Analysis of Government Platforms and Key Technology Partners**

## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the technology companies and commercial frameworks underpinning the United Kingdom's multifaceted digital identity initiatives. The UK government is pursuing a dual-track strategy. The first track involves the in-house development of a core digital identity infrastructure, comprising the **GOV.UK One Login** platform and the user-facing **GOV.UK Wallet** application. This central system is being built with substantial support from a cohort of major technology and consulting firms, including **Deloitte, PA Consulting, Accenture, iProov,** and **Experian**, who have been awarded contracts collectively valued in the tens of millions of pounds.  
The second track of the strategy is the simultaneous cultivation of a regulated, federated market of private-sector Identity Service Providers (IDSPs). This market is governed by the **UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF)**, which certifies companies to provide trusted identity verification services for a range of use cases. Key players in this certified ecosystem include established digital identity specialists such as **Yoti, GB Group (GBG),** and **Onfido**, among many others. These firms are already active in providing digital checks for Right to Work, Right to Rent, and criminal record (DBS) screenings.  
A central finding of this analysis is the strategic tension between a long-term, technically-driven programme and a short-term, politically-motivated policy objective. The GOV.UK One Login platform has been in development for years with the goal of creating a universal single sign-on for all government services. This infrastructure is now being leveraged to deliver the politically branded "BritCard" initiative, a mandatory digital ID for employment checks, framed primarily as a tool to control illegal migration. This repurposing ties the technical success of a foundational government platform to the public and political acceptance of a highly contentious policy, creating significant delivery risk. The following report deconstructs this complex ecosystem, detailing the specific roles, contract values, and strategic implications of the public-private partnerships shaping the future of digital identity in the UK.

## **Section 1: The Strategic Landscape of UK Digital Identity**

To understand the commercial and technological partnerships involved in the UK's digital identity system, it is essential to first deconstruct the complex policy, governance, and political environment in which it operates. The government's approach is not a single, monolithic project but a combination of a central technology platform, a specific policy application, and a regulated private market, each with distinct origins and objectives.

### **1.1 Differentiating Policy from Platform: "BritCard" vs. GOV.UK One Login**

The public discourse surrounding the UK's digital ID has been dominated by the term "BritCard," but this is a political brand rather than a distinct technology system.1 The "BritCard" represents a mandatory digital identity policy initiative, driven by the current government's "Plan for Change".3 Its primary stated purpose is to combat illegal immigration and exploitative labour practices by making digital Right to Work checks compulsory for all employers by the end of the current parliament.2  
This policy will be implemented using a pre-existing and long-running technology programme: **GOV.UK One Login**.5 One Login is the government's strategic platform designed to create a single, unified sign-on for all central government services, replacing a fragmented landscape of over 190 different sign-in routes and 44 separate accounts.7 Its development predates the "BritCard" announcement, with its core objectives focused on simplifying user access, improving service delivery, and increasing government efficiency.10 The digital ID credential itself, containing details such as name, date of birth, photo, and residency status, will be stored within the  
**GOV.UK Wallet**, a secure smartphone application also being developed to hold other digital documents, starting with the Digital Driving Licence.1  
This approach reveals a strategic repurposing of digital infrastructure. The government is leveraging a long-term, technically-focused platform (One Login) to deliver on a more immediate and politically charged policy objective (controlling illegal migration via the "BritCard"). This is not a new system being built from scratch for immigration enforcement; rather, it is the application of a specific, high-stakes use case to an existing, general-purpose platform. This decision carries significant project risk. The technical success and public adoption of the foundational One Login system are now inextricably linked to the political and public acceptance of the mandatory "BritCard" concept, a policy that has already generated considerable opposition, including a petition with over 1.6 million signatures and widespread criticism from civil liberties groups.2

### **1.2 Governance and Oversight: Mapping the Institutional Framework**

The delivery and governance of the UK's digital identity ecosystem are distributed across several key government bodies, each with a distinct remit.

* **Government Digital Service (GDS):** As the "digital centre of government," GDS is the primary technical delivery body. It is responsible for the design, development, and operation of the core technology platforms, including GOV.UK One Login and the GOV.UK Wallet.12  
* **Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT):** GDS is an operational unit within DSIT, which holds the broader policy responsibility for enabling the adoption of digital identity services across the entire UK economy, extending beyond central government services.12  
* **Office for Digital Identities and Attributes (OfDIA):** Established within DSIT, OfDIA is the dedicated regulatory body for the private digital identity market.6 Its primary function is to oversee and maintain the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF), which sets the rules and standards that private providers must meet to become certified.15  
* **Cabinet Office & Home Office:** The political impetus for the "BritCard" initiative originates from the Prime Minister's office and aligns with core Home Office objectives related to immigration enforcement and border security.1 Cabinet Office ministers have also framed the digital ID system as the "bedrock of the modern state," enabling future public service reform.19

This distributed structure separates technical delivery (GDS) from market regulation (OfDIA) and broader policy (DSIT), while the political direction is set by the centre of government.

### **1.3 Historical Context: Lessons from the Failure of GOV.UK Verify**

The government's current dual-track strategy is heavily informed by the failure of its previous national digital identity scheme, **GOV.UK Verify**, which was formally shut down in April 2023 after operating for seven years.20 Verify was architected on a purely federated model, where the government did not provide an identity service itself. Instead, users were required to choose from a list of certified private companies (such as the Post Office, Experian, and Digidentity) to verify their identity before accessing government services.20  
The system ultimately failed for several reasons. It struggled to achieve widespread user adoption, and many users found the process of signing up with a third-party provider confusing. Crucially, it did not meet the diverse identity assurance requirements of all government departments, leading many to continue using their own legacy systems.20  
The current strategy of building a central, government-owned system (One Login) while simultaneously maintaining a regulated private market (the DIATF) can be seen as a direct corrective measure to address the architectural and commercial failures of Verify. The failure of the Verify model demonstrated the inherent weaknesses of a system entirely reliant on a fragmented market of private providers, which could not guarantee the universal access, consistent user experience, and deep integration required for core government services. In response, the government now recognizes the necessity of a central, publicly-owned "public option" for identity—the role fulfilled by One Login—to ensure it can serve all citizens and maintain control over access to critical public services.10  
However, the government also acknowledges the value, innovation, and existing capabilities of the UK's private digital identity market, which already generates an estimated £2 billion in annual revenue and is deeply integrated into processes like Right to Work checks.3 The DIATF is therefore an evolution of the Verify certification concept, creating a more robust and transparent set of rules for this private market. The creation of One Login alongside it represents the government's admission that it cannot entirely outsource this critical national infrastructure. This dual-track approach is a deliberate attempt to achieve the "best of both worlds": the universal reach of a public system and the innovation of a competitive private market, thereby avoiding a repeat of Verify's shortcomings.

## **Section 2: The Core Infrastructure: Prime Contractors of GOV.UK One Login**

The development of the central GOV.UK One Login platform is not being conducted by civil servants alone. The Government Digital Service (GDS) has engaged a number of major private technology and consulting firms through multi-million-pound contracts to provide essential capabilities, from overall programme delivery and technical architecture to specialist components like biometric verification.

### **2.1 Architectural Overview: One Login and the GOV.UK Wallet**

GOV.UK One Login serves as the secure single sign-on and identity-checking engine for the UK government. It is designed to replace the myriad of existing login systems with one consistent user journey, incorporating modern security standards such as two-factor authentication.8 When a user needs to prove their identity to a high level of assurance, they can use the  
**GOV.UK ID Check app**, which is part of the One Login system.21 This app allows users to scan a photo ID document (like a passport or driving licence) and verify their likeness using their phone's camera.21  
The verified digital identity credential will ultimately be stored in the **GOV.UK Wallet**, a separate smartphone application that acts as a secure container for various digital documents issued by the government.1 This wallet is designed to function similarly to how users already store contactless payment cards or airline tickets on their phones, protected by the device's inherent security features like Face ID or a passcode.1

### **2.2 Primary Capability and Delivery Partners**

Analysis of government contracts reveals a delivery model heavily reliant on external consulting firms for core technical, managerial, and strategic capabilities. These firms are not merely providing niche software but are deeply embedded in the programme's delivery structure.

* **Deloitte:** The professional services firm is a primary "capability delivery partner" for the One Login programme, with a portfolio of contracts valued at over £35 million.22 Its engagements include a £4.8 million contract (later uplifted) for the development of the mobile identity verification app, a £9.5 million capability deal, and a further £16 million contract to provide skills, assist with software code development, and support the overall delivery of the solution.9 The terms of its £16 million contract explicitly state that Deloitte is expected to help transfer knowledge and skills back to GDS civil servants, indicating a current skills gap within the government's own teams.22  
* **PA Consulting:** Another key partner, PA Consulting, holds a £9.5 million contract as a "capability delivery partner," running concurrently with Deloitte's similar deal.9 In addition, the firm secured a separate two-year, £8 million contract specifically for the provision of "technical architecture services" to the digital identity programme, highlighting its central role in shaping the system's technical blueprint.23  
* **Accenture:** Accenture has been contracted as the programme's primary cybersecurity services provider. It was awarded a two-year, £9.5 million contract to deliver "cyber security services" for the digital ID work.23 This contract was awarded amidst significant public scrutiny of the platform's security, with the government stating that such deals bring in "specialist technical expertise" to ensure the system remains "secure, reliable and resilient".23

The scale and nature of these contracts with Deloitte, PA Consulting, and Accenture point to a delivery model of augmentation and dependency. The contract values represent a substantial portion of the project's total forecast cost of £305 million.22 The roles are not for peripheral tasks but for fundamental capabilities in delivery, architecture, and security. The inclusion of a knowledge-transfer mandate in Deloitte's contract is a clear acknowledgement that the required Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) skills are not presently available at the necessary scale within the civil service. While this model allows GDS to scale its delivery capacity rapidly, it introduces significant commercial risks, including high costs, the potential for long-term vendor lock-in, and the challenge of retaining critical institutional knowledge after the contracts conclude.

### **2.3 Specialist Technology and Data Providers**

While consulting firms provide overarching delivery support, GDS is also procuring specialized, market-leading solutions for critical technology functions. This "best-of-breed" component strategy shows the government acting as a prime systems integrator rather than attempting to build every part of the technology stack from scratch.

* **iProov:** This UK-based firm is a global leader in biometric verification and liveness detection. It has been awarded two crucial contracts for the One Login programme. The first is a £5.9 million contract for biometrics, which underpins the facial verification process where a user proves they are a real person present at that moment. The second is a larger £11.6 million contract for a "genuine document check service," which includes the technology to read the chip in modern passports and identity documents using a smartphone's Near Field Communication (NFC) capability.9  
* **Experian:** The global data and credit reporting agency has also been awarded significant contracts. It holds three One Login-specific contracts with a total value of approximately £18 million.9 While the precise services are not fully detailed in public records, Experian's core business suggests its role is focused on data-centric identity assurance. This likely involves providing knowledge-based verification (KBV)—where users are asked security questions that only they should know the answer to, based on their financial or other records—and validating user-provided information against its extensive data holdings. This aligns with GDS's stated intention to use wider government and private data sources to improve inclusivity for users who may not have standard photo ID.24

This procurement approach demonstrates a mature architectural strategy. Building world-class biometric liveness detection or maintaining comprehensive national data sets for identity validation are highly specialized and capital-intensive fields. By procuring these capabilities from market leaders like iProov and Experian, GDS can de-risk its technical delivery, accelerate development, and focus its in-house efforts on the core platform, user experience, and overall service integration.

### **2.4 Ancillary Service Providers**

Beyond the core technology and delivery partners, the One Login programme has engaged other suppliers for supporting services. Notably, **FOUR COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED** was awarded a £670,000 contract for public relations. The contract's objective is to "maintain a clear drumbeat narrative that raises awareness, inspires confidence and enhances GDS's reputation" for the One Login programme, highlighting the government's awareness of the need to manage public perception of the project.25 Other firms, including  
**Kin and Carta, The Dextrous Web,** and **Thoughtworks**, have been awarded contracts for publishing and search functions on the wider GOV.UK platform that One Login serves.9

| Company | Role / Service Provided | Contract Value(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Deloitte** | Capability Delivery Partner, Mobile App Development | £16M, £9.5M, £7.2M+ (Total \>£35M) |
| **PA Consulting** | Capability Delivery Partner, Technical Architecture | £9.5M, £8M (Total £17.5M) |
| **Accenture** | Cybersecurity Services | £9.5M |
| **Experian** | Data Verification / Identity Assurance | \~£18M (across 3 contracts) |
| **iProov** | Biometric Verification, Genuine Document Check (NFC) | £5.9M, £11.6M (Total £17.5M) |
| **FOUR COMMUNICATIONS** | Public Relations | £670,000 |

## **Section 3: The Federated Market: The UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF)**

The government's strategy extends beyond its own central platform. The second track involves fostering a regulated, competitive marketplace of private-sector digital identity companies. This is crucial for understanding that GOV.UK One Login will not be the sole method for proving digital identity in the UK, particularly for transactions outside of central government.

### **3.1 The Purpose and Function of the Trust Framework**

The **UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF)** is a set of government-defined rules, technical standards, and governance processes that digital identity service providers must adhere to.6 Private companies can voluntarily undergo a rigorous assessment process conducted by independent conformity assessment bodies. If they meet the required standards for security, privacy, and performance, they become certified Identity Service Providers (IDSPs) and are awarded a government "trustmark" that signals their reliability to the market.23  
The framework is overseen by the Office for Digital Identities and Attributes (OfDIA) within DSIT.6 Its primary goal is to create a trusted and interoperable ecosystem where citizens and businesses can confidently use a range of certified private-sector digital ID services for various real-world transactions. The initial focus for these certified services has been on high-volume, legally mandated checks, including Right to Work, Right to Rent, and Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal record checks.3 This allows employers, landlords, and other organizations to use certified digital methods instead of manual document inspection.

### **3.2 Market Analysis of Certified IDSPs**

The official register of certified services reveals a broad and mature market of digital identity providers already operating in the UK.28 These range from dedicated digital ID startups to global data intelligence corporations. This ecosystem demonstrates that significant private sector capability exists, which the government aims to leverage rather than replace entirely.  
Key players certified under the DIATF include:

* **Yoti Ltd:** A prominent London-based company offering a consumer-facing digital ID app that can be used for a variety of purposes. Yoti is certified for multiple services on the framework, including its own "Yoti Digital ID" as well as white-label solutions it powers for other brands, such as "Post Office EasyID" and "Lloyds Bank Smart ID".28  
* **GB Group PLC (GBG):** A global identity data intelligence specialist headquartered in the UK. GBG is certified for several of its services, including "Identify" and "IDscan Enterprise," which are used for identity verification in sectors like finance and gaming, and are approved for Right to Work, Right to Rent, and DBS checks.27  
* **Onfido Ltd:** A specialist in AI-powered document verification and biometric facial recognition. Its "Real Identity Platform" is certified under the framework, allowing businesses to use its technology for compliant identity checks.26  
* **Digidentity B.V.:** A Dutch company with a long history in the UK market, having previously been a provider for the GOV.UK Verify scheme. Its "Digidentity Wallet" is certified under the new framework.20  
* **Experian Limited and Deloitte LLP:** Notably, both of these major government contractors for the One Login programme also have separate commercial services certified on the DIATF. Experian's "CrossCore2" and Deloitte's "Go Verify" are listed on the register, demonstrating that these firms operate on both sides of the public-private divide.28

The register includes dozens of other certified companies, such as **Thirdfort, OneID, Amiqus Resolution, ComplyCube,** and **Veridas**, each offering services certified for specific roles (e.g., Identity Provider, Attribute Provider, Orchestration Service) and approved for specific legal use cases.28 This diversity illustrates a competitive marketplace that pre-dates the government's latest initiatives and which the DIATF seeks to formalize and govern.

| Company Name | Selected Certified Service(s) | Certified Role Types | Certified Use Cases |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Yoti Ltd** | Yoti Digital ID, Post Office EasyID | Identity, Attribute, Orchestration | Right to Work, Right to Rent, DBS |
| **GB Group PLC** | Identify 0.25.1, IDscan Enterprise | Identity | Right to Work, Right to Rent, DBS |
| **Onfido Ltd** | Onfido Real Identity Platform | Identity | Right to Work, Right to Rent, DBS |
| **Experian Limited** | CrossCore2 | Identity | Right to Work, Right to Rent, DBS |
| **Digidentity B.V.** | Digidentity Wallet | Identity | Right to Work, Right to Rent, DBS |
| **Thirdfort Limited** | Thirdfort app | Identity, Attribute | Right to Work, Right to Rent, DBS |
| **OneID Limited** | OneID, OneID ID Scan | Identity, Holder, Orchestration | Right to Work, Right to Rent, DBS |
| **Deloitte LLP** | Go Verify | Identity | Right to Work |

## **Section 4: Strategic Analysis and Forward Outlook**

Synthesizing the analysis of the government's core platform development and its regulation of the federated market reveals a complex, interdependent, and potentially competitive future for the UK's digital identity landscape. The success of the entire endeavor hinges not only on technical execution but also on navigating significant political, commercial, and social challenges.

### **4.1 Public-Private Interdependencies and Competition**

The government's dual-track strategy creates a dynamic of "co-opetition," where it is simultaneously a partner, a regulator, and a future competitor to the private digital identity market.  
First, the government is a **partner** and client. The GOV.UK One Login system is fundamentally dependent on private sector expertise, integrating specialized "best-of-breed" technology from firms like iProov for biometrics and Experian for data validation.9 It also relies heavily on consulting firms like Deloitte and PA Consulting for the core delivery and architecture of the system itself.22  
Second, the government is the **regulator**. Through DSIT and OfDIA, it sets the rules for the entire market via the DIATF.16 All players, public and private, must adhere to these standards to be considered trustworthy. This was starkly illustrated by the revelation that GDS's own One Login system had lost its formal trustmark certification and was in the process of seeking recertification.23 This demonstrates that the government's own platform is subject to the same regulatory scrutiny it applies to the private sector, at least in principle.  
Third, the government is positioning itself as a future **competitor**. Once the GOV.UK Wallet is fully functional and widely adopted, it will directly compete with private-sector digital ID wallets, such as those offered by Yoti or Digidentity. If the government mandates the use of the GOV.UK Wallet for an expanding range of interactions with the state—from paying taxes to accessing healthcare—it could become the dominant, default digital ID for citizens, potentially marginalizing private alternatives.  
This complex relationship creates an uncertain future for the private market. While these firms are essential to the ecosystem's success today, they also face the long-term risk of being out-competed by a state-provided solution that benefits from the government's unique ability to mandate its use. The future viability and growth of the private market will depend heavily on the degree of interoperability the government builds into its systems and whether it allows citizens to use their preferred certified IDSP to interact with government services, rather than locking them into the GOV.UK Wallet.

### **4.2 Market Opportunities and Commercial Risks**

The national rollout of a digital ID framework, regardless of its final form, creates immense commercial opportunities for technology vendors. Beyond the direct, high-value contracts for building the central government system, the framework will drive the wider adoption of digital identity verification across the entire economy. As citizens become more accustomed to using digital IDs, demand will grow for their use in banking, e-commerce, age verification for restricted goods and services, and secure corporate logins.6  
However, the programme faces a number of profound risks that could derail its progress:

* **Technical and Security Risks:** The project is one of the most complex and sensitive undertakings in public sector IT. The fact that GDS temporarily lost its own trustmark for One Login highlights the significant security and compliance hurdles involved.23 The system will be an "enormous hacking target," and a single catastrophic data breach could irrevocably destroy public trust and halt the entire initiative.1  
* **Political and Public Opposition:** The mandatory nature of the "BritCard" for employment has ignited a fierce backlash from civil liberties groups and the public. Concerns about state surveillance, data privacy, and the creation of a "digital prison" are widespread.4 A petition opposing the scheme has garnered over 1.6 million signatures, ensuring parliamentary debate and sustained political pressure.2 This public and political opposition represents the single greatest threat to the programme's successful implementation, irrespective of the technology's quality.  
* **Digital Exclusion:** Despite government assurances that non-digital alternatives will be available, there are significant concerns that a mandatory digital system will exclude or disadvantage vulnerable groups, including the elderly, the homeless, people with disabilities, or those without smartphones or digital literacy.3 GDS is actively researching solutions to improve inclusion, such as "digital vouching" and using wider government data sets, but ensuring no one is left behind remains a critical challenge.24

### **4.3 Projected Evolution (2025-2029)**

Based on government announcements and the current project trajectory, the UK's digital identity ecosystem is expected to evolve significantly in the coming years.  
The initial mandatory implementation will be focused on Right to Work checks, which the government aims to enforce by the end of the current parliament, likely before 2029\.5 Following this, an expansion of use cases is planned, with the digital ID intended to simplify access to a wider range of public and private services, including applying for welfare, renting property, and opening bank accounts.1  
Concurrently, the private market governed by the DIATF is expected to mature. As more sectors of the economy are required or encouraged to use certified digital identity checks, the number of certified IDSPs will likely grow, and competition will increase. A key development to monitor will be the level of interoperability between these private services and the central GOV.UK Wallet.  
In conclusion, the technical foundations of the UK's digital identity system are being laid by a combination of in-house government teams at GDS and a select group of major technology contractors responsible for core delivery, security, and specialist components. This central system will coexist with a regulated market of private providers certified to offer identity services. While the technology is advancing, the ultimate success and societal impact of the UK's digital ID system will be determined less by its code and contractors, and more by its ability to navigate the profound political, social, and security challenges that lie ahead.
