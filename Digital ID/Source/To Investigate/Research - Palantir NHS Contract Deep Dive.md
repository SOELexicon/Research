# **The £330 Million Gamble: An Investigation into Palantir, the NHS, and the Future of UK Health Data**

## **Introduction: A System in Crisis, A Solution in Question**

The UK's National Health Service (NHS), a cherished public institution, has long been hampered by a critical flaw in its digital nervous system. Its data infrastructure is a fragmented patchwork of disparate, legacy IT systems that cannot effectively communicate with one another.1 This digital disconnect creates profound inefficiencies, places a heavy administrative burden on clinical staff who spend valuable time manually trying to join up information, and ultimately leads to delays in patient care.1 It is within this context of systemic dysfunction that NHS England, on November 21, 2023, announced its flagship solution: the Federated Data Platform (FDP).1  
Presented as a transformative software layer, the FDP is designed to sit across NHS trusts and regional Integrated Care Systems (ICSs). Its stated purpose is to connect vital health information, allowing staff to better manage patient care, tackle waiting lists, and streamline processes like hospital discharges.1 The ambition is to create a digitised, connected NHS that can deliver services more effectively and efficiently.7  
However, the announcement was immediately engulfed in controversy. The seven-year contract, valued at up to £330 million, was awarded to a consortium led by Palantir Technologies UK, an American data analytics firm with deep and controversial roots in the military, intelligence, and state surveillance sectors.5 This decision ignited a fierce national debate, creating a fundamental tension between the promise of digital modernisation and profound public and professional alarm over data privacy, corporate secrecy, and the suitability of the chosen vendor.11  
The Palantir-NHS contract is not merely a technology procurement but a critical juncture for the UK's public health system. It represents the culmination of a multi-year campaign of corporate influence that leveraged a national crisis to secure an entrenched position. The resulting deal poses significant, potentially irreversible risks to public trust, data sovereignty, and the foundational values of the NHS, demanding unprecedented scrutiny.

## **Part I: Anatomy of a Controversial Contract**

The legal and commercial architecture of the Federated Data Platform deal is complex and has been characterised by an opacity that has fuelled public mistrust from its inception. A detailed examination of the contract, its partners, and the surrounding procurement process reveals a structure seemingly designed to obscure rather than illuminate.

### **Deconstructing the Deal: The Financial Architecture**

The headline figure for the FDP contract is **£330 million over a seven-year period**.1 In its first year, the projected investment is at least £25.6 million.1 However, the official award notice published on the government's Contracts Finder portal presents a more nuanced picture. It details an initial contract period running from November 22, 2023, to February 15, 2027, with a value of  
**£182,242,760**.16  
Crucially, the notice clarifies that this is not a committed amount. The agreement operates on a flexible, consumption-based model where NHS England pays for services as they are used, according to an agreed pricing schedule. The £330 million figure is described as a "forecasted amount," which is also "not a committed amount".16 This structure minimises the initial declared value while creating a framework for costs to potentially escalate as more NHS trusts are onboarded, embedding the supplier more deeply into the system over time. The procurement itself was conducted via a "Competitive dialogue (above threshold)" procedure, a method reserved for particularly complex contracts where potential solutions are discussed and refined with a pre-selected group of suppliers.16

### **The Consortium: A Network of Insiders**

The contract was awarded not to Palantir in isolation, but to a consortium it leads, comprising a powerful network of companies with long-standing and lucrative relationships with the UK government and the NHS.1 This structure serves to diffuse responsibility while embedding established government contractors at the heart of the project.

* **Accenture:** A global management consulting and professional services firm with a vast portfolio of public sector contracts. It has worked extensively with the NHS, the Ministry of Defence, and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), bringing experience in large-scale digital transformation projects.17  
* **PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers):** One of the "Big Four" accounting and consulting firms, PwC has a deeply entrenched advisory role across the UK government. Its expertise spans public sector strategy, procurement reform, and large-scale project assurance, making it an integral part of the government contracting ecosystem.20  
* **Carnall Farrar (CF):** A specialist management consultancy focused exclusively on healthcare. Its co-founder, Dame Ruth Carnall, is a former Chief Executive of NHS London, giving the firm an intimate, insider's understanding of the NHS landscape and its operational challenges.23 The firm has worked with over 15 health and social care systems in England, handling large volumes of NHS data for analytics projects.23  
* **NECS (North of England Care System Support):** An NHS body that provides commissioning support services to other NHS organisations. Its inclusion lends a veneer of in-house NHS legitimacy to the predominantly private consortium. NECS had a pre-existing working relationship with Palantir, having collaborated on the Improving Elective Care Coordination for Patients (IECCP) programme, which piloted Palantir's software in 36 NHS Trusts.25

### **A Contract Shrouded in Secrecy: The Redaction Scandal**

The lack of transparency surrounding the contract became a major scandal in itself. When the 586-page document was first published on December 22, 2023, an astonishing **417 pages were completely redacted**.15  
Most alarmingly, the blacked-out sections included the bulk of the chapter titled **"protection of personal data"**—the very issue of greatest public concern.15 Also concealed were details regarding financial reporting obligations, key personnel, and their specific roles and responsibilities.15 This extreme secrecy immediately triggered legal action from the  
**Good Law Project**, a non-profit campaign group. They argued that the redactions were unlawful, flouted the government's own transparency guidelines, and made public scrutiny impossible.26  
Under this legal pressure, NHS England published a less-redacted version of the contract in March 2024\.5 However, this partial victory for transparency brought with it a more shocking revelation. In legal correspondence with the Good Law Project, NHS England made the "alarming admission" that parts of its contract with Palantir, including critical sections on the protection of personal data,  
**were still being negotiated even after the deal had been formally signed and awarded**.26  
This disclosure fundamentally undermines the integrity of the procurement. A fair and lawful process requires all bidders to compete on a clearly defined and agreed-upon set of terms. By awarding the contract before these crucial negotiations were complete, NHS England effectively gave Palantir a winning ticket without finalising the rules of the game. This provided the company with immense leverage to shape the most sensitive obligations in its favour after securing the deal, lending significant weight to claims that the selection of Palantir was a predetermined outcome, with the contractual details treated as a secondary matter to be resolved later.

### **The Privacy Fig Leaf? IQVIA and the PET Contract**

In a move seemingly designed to assuage public fears, NHS England announced a separate, parallel contract for **Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET)**. This was awarded to **IQVIA**, a major US-based multinational serving the life sciences and clinical research industries.2 The FDP is positioned as the first use case for this new NHS-PET, which is described as an "additional safeguard" to enhance the security of data used in the platform.1 NHS England has stated that the FDP will not go live in trusts until this technology is in place.1  
However, this attempt at reassurance was immediately undermined. The contract with IQVIA was also subject to massive redactions, with approximately three-quarters of the document blacked out—including, with deep irony, the section on the protection of personal data.26 Furthermore, IQVIA is a controversial entity in its own right. The doctor and academic Ben Goldacre has previously raised concerns about a power imbalance in IQVIA's relationship with the NHS, suggesting the firm could aggregate and sell NHS hospital data to the pharmaceutical industry while contractually restricting the NHS's own access to these collated insights.27 This context makes the opaque PET contract appear less like a robust safeguard and more like a public relations tool designed to provide a superficial layer of independent oversight.

## **Part II: The Path to Power: How Palantir Captured the NHS**

The awarding of the FDP contract to Palantir was not the outcome of a simple, standalone competition. It was the culmination of a multi-year strategic campaign to embed the company and its technology within the NHS, a process that saw it cultivate high-level influence, leverage a national crisis to gain an unassailable foothold, and benefit from a revolving door of personnel between the public and private sectors.

### **The Pre-Pandemic Charm Offensive: Cultivating Influence**

Long before the COVID-19 pandemic created an emergency justification for its services, Palantir was actively pursuing a relationship with the highest echelons of the UK health service. An investigation by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, based on internal government documents, uncovered a sustained "charm offensive" that began in the summer of 2019\.31  
A pivotal event occurred on July 2, 2019, when Palantir's UK head, Louis Mosley, hosted a dinner attended by Lord David Prior, then-chair of NHS England. Over "watermelon cocktails," the conversation focused on potential future uses of the NHS's vast data assets.31 This was followed by email exchanges and offers for software demonstrations in San Francisco and at the World Economic Forum in Davos, with discussions extending to Matthew Gould, the chief executive of the newly formed technology arm, NHSX.31 By January 2020, Palantir was already developing a product "focused exclusively on the health care market in the UK".31  
This access extended to the very top of government. Leaked documents later revealed a secret meeting took place on August 28, 2019, between Palantir's co-founder, **Peter Thiel**, and then-Prime Minister **Boris Johnson** and his chief advisor **Dominic Cummings**. This meeting was never declared in official records.32

### **The £1 Trojan Horse: Weaponising a Crisis**

The COVID-19 pandemic provided the perfect opportunity for Palantir to convert this cultivated influence into a concrete contractual relationship. In March 2020, as the crisis unfolded, the government awarded Palantir an "emergency" contract to help build the **NHS COVID-19 Data Store**. Bypassing the normal competitive tendering process, the initial contract was for the token sum of **£1**.34  
This £1 deal was a strategic masterstroke, functioning as a Trojan horse that gave Palantir unprecedented access to the inner workings of the NHS's data infrastructure and operational challenges. It allowed the company to deeply integrate its proprietary **Foundry software** into the heart of the UK's pandemic response, managing data on everything from PPE and ventilators to the vaccine rollout.37  
The nominal fee quickly escalated into a multi-million-pound engagement. The initial deal was followed by a **£1 million** contract in July 2020, which was then extended into a **£23.5 million, two-year deal** in December 2020\.31 This expanded contract went far beyond the immediate COVID response, covering "general business-as-usual monitoring," a scope extension that prompted legal action from openDemocracy and Foxglove over the lack of public consultation.31 This sequence of non-competitive awards, justified by the emergency, created a powerful  
**incumbent advantage**. Palantir was no longer just a potential supplier; it was the embedded operator of the national NHS data platform. This fact was later highlighted by the National Data Guardian, who explicitly warned that NHS England needed to demonstrate how this advantage had been mitigated in the subsequent FDP procurement.42

### **Cementing Incumbency: The "Transition" Contract**

The perception that Palantir's victory in the FDP competition was a foregone conclusion was solidified in June 2023\. While the formal procurement process was still officially ongoing, NHS England awarded Palantir a further **£24.9 million contract** specifically to "transition" its existing work from the COVID-19 Data Store to the new, yet-to-be-awarded Federated Data Platform.35 This move was widely criticised as making a mockery of the competitive process, as Palantir was now being paid to build the bridge to a platform it was supposedly still competing to win.35

### **The Revolving Door: A Network of Influence**

The flow of senior personnel between the NHS, government bodies, and the companies within the FDP consortium has raised serious questions about conflicts of interest and the use of insider knowledge. This "revolving door" phenomenon appears to have been a key factor in Palantir's successful entrenchment within the UK health system.

| Name | Former Public Sector Role(s) & Timeline | Subsequent Private Sector Role & Company | Significance / Connection to FDP |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Dr Indra Joshi** | Director of AI, NHSX (2019-2022) 44 | Director, Health, Research & AI, Palantir Technologies 45 | Oversaw NHS AI strategy and data governance policy. Joined Palantir as the FDP procurement, a major AI and data project, was ramping up. 44 |
| **Harjeet Dhaliwal** | Deputy Director of Data Services, NHS England (spent \~20 years in NHS) 47 | Deployment Strategist, Palantir Technologies 47 | Led on building national data repositories for NHS England. Joined Palantir in 2022 during the run-up to the FDP award. 44 |
| **Matthew Swindells** | Deputy Chief Executive, NHS England 50 | Consultant, Global Counsel (a firm hired by Palantir for lobbying) 50 | Advised Palantir on its NHS strategy via a consultancy firm after leaving one of the most senior operational roles in NHS England. 51 |
| **Dame Ruth Carnall** | Chief Executive, NHS London (until 2013\) 24 | Co-founder and Chairman, Carnall Farrar 24 | Co-founded a key partner in the FDP consortium after a 30-year career at all levels of the NHS, including as a top executive. 24 |
| **Stephen Hay** | Deputy Chief Executive, NHS Improvement (2013-2019) 52 | Health Industries Leader, PwC UK 52 | Joined another key FDP consortium partner after holding a top regulatory and operational role overseeing NHS providers. 52 |
| **Ming Tang** | Senior Partner, Accenture (pre-2009) 53 | Chief Data & Analytics Officer, NHS England; Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) for the FDP 55 | The key NHS official responsible for the FDP programme is a former Partner at Accenture, a lead member of the winning consortium. 53 |

This movement of personnel is not merely about individuals finding new employment; it represents a systemic transfer of institutional knowledge that tilts the procurement landscape. When senior officials with intimate knowledge of the NHS's internal structures, data challenges, and procurement psychology move to a supplier, they provide that company with invaluable strategic intelligence. This creates a fundamental asymmetry of information, making a truly "open and competitive" process practically impossible and ensuring the incumbent, now staffed with former insiders, is best placed to win.

## **Part III: The Company Under the Microscope**

To fully understand the controversy surrounding the FDP contract, it is essential to examine the corporate identity of its lead supplier. Palantir's origins, its history of controversial work, and the stated ideology of its founder reveal a corporate DNA that many argue is fundamentally misaligned with the ethical principles of a public health service.

### **From the CIA to the NHS: A Lineage of Surveillance**

Palantir Technologies was founded in 2003 by a group including libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel and current CEO Alex Karp. A crucial source of its early seed funding was **In-Q-Tel**, the venture capital arm of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).31 The company's mission was born from the post-9/11 security landscape: to adapt the fraud-detection software concepts from Thiel's previous venture, PayPal, for use by the US intelligence community.58  
Its two flagship software platforms, **Gotham** and **Foundry**, are designed to serve this purpose. They are powerful data integration and analysis tools built for large, complex organisations—primarily government agencies in defence, intelligence, and law enforcement—to make sense of vast, siloed datasets.60 The NHS Federated Data Platform is built upon Palantir's Foundry software.14 The company's very name, taken from the all-seeing "seeing stones" in  
*The Lord of the Rings*, carries an ominous symbolism for a firm specialising in data analysis.60

### **A Legacy of Controversy: Palantir's Ethical Track Record**

Palantir's history is marked by a series of high-profile, controversial contracts that have placed it at the centre of debates on surveillance, civil liberties, and human rights.

* **Work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):** Palantir has held long-term, multi-million dollar contracts to provide ICE with data analysis tools. Its **Investigative Case Management (ICM)** and **FALCON** systems have been instrumental in building profiles of immigrants, planning large-scale workplace raids, and facilitating deportations.64 Documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests explicitly linked Palantir's software to an operation that targeted the family members and sponsors of unaccompanied migrant children, leading to accusations that the company's technology was complicit in the Trump administration's family separation policies.66  
* **Predictive Policing:** The company's software has been deployed in "predictive policing" programs by US law enforcement agencies, including in New Orleans and Los Angeles.11 These systems, which use historical crime data to forecast where crime is likely to occur, have been heavily criticised by civil liberties groups for embedding and amplifying existing racial biases in policing, leading to the disproportionate surveillance and targeting of minority communities.69 Palantir has since stated it has a company policy not to engage in such work.71  
* **Military and Intelligence Operations:** Palantir is deeply embedded within the US and allied military-industrial complexes. Its technology supports drone targeting programs, battlefield intelligence analysis, and mass surveillance operations.72 CEO Alex Karp has spoken of the company's mission to provide Western governments with a decisive technological edge, enabling them to "scare enemies and on occasion kill them".63  
* **Support for the Israeli Military:** In the wake of the October 7th attacks, Palantir publicly affirmed its support for Israel and signed a strategic partnership to provide "advanced technology provision... in support of war related missions".9 This has become a focal point for protests by UK health workers, who see this partnership as incompatible with the values of the NHS.9

### **A Question of Values: Thiel, the NHS, and Ideological Conflict**

The ideological chasm between Palantir's leadership and the NHS is stark. The company's co-founder and chairman, **Peter Thiel**, is a prominent libertarian, a major financial backer of Donald Trump, and a vocal critic of the NHS.12  
In a widely publicised 2023 debate at the Oxford Union, Thiel described the British public's deep affection for the NHS as a form of **"Stockholm syndrome."** He went on to suggest that the only viable path to reform was to "rip the whole thing from the ground and start over".50 This statement reveals a fundamental ideological opposition to the very concept of a universal, publicly funded healthcare system. The profound incongruity of entrusting the core data infrastructure of an institution to a company led by an individual who advocates for its dismantlement lies at the heart of the public and professional backlash against the FDP contract.  
This is not merely a historical footnote but is directly relevant to the NHS contract. The ethical controversies reveal a corporate culture and a technical capability geared towards surveillance and the categorisation of individuals—or "social sorting." Palantir's standard defence is that its software is a neutral tool and that the customer retains full control of the data.37 However, its work with ICE and in predictive policing demonstrates that its tools are designed and optimised for identifying, tracking, and flagging individuals based on aggregated data profiles. While the stated purpose within the NHS is operational efficiency, the underlying technical capacity for more granular population analysis remains. Given historical instances of data sharing between the NHS and the Home Office for immigration enforcement, the risk of "mission creep"—where a tool built for one purpose is later used for another—is significant and credible. The opposition to Palantir is therefore not just "ideology," as its executives claim, but a rational concern based on the company's demonstrated capabilities and the potential for those capabilities to be repurposed in ways that could erode the principle of a confidential and safe healthcare space for all patients.74

## **Part IV: Resistance and Reality on the Ground**

The Federated Data Platform contract faces a critical deficit of trust that threatens its successful implementation. Opposition is not confined to fringe activist groups; it is broad-based, coming from the UK's largest doctors' union, privacy campaigners, Members of Parliament, and, most damagingly, from within the NHS's own ranks of data professionals. This widespread resistance suggests the project's viability is in serious jeopardy.

### **A Chorus of Dissent: The Campaign Against Palantir**

A diverse coalition of organisations has mounted a sustained campaign against Palantir's involvement in the NHS.

* **The British Medical Association (BMA):** As the union representing the majority of UK doctors, the BMA's opposition is highly influential. In a landmark move at its June 2025 Annual Representative Meeting, it passed a motion declaring Palantir an **"unacceptable choice of partner"**.78 The BMA is now officially lobbying for the termination of all Palantir contracts, citing grave concerns over transparency, public trust, and the company's ethical track record, including its work on "discriminatory policing software" and its links to foreign governments.13  
* **Legal and Privacy Campaigners:** A group of non-profit organisations has been relentless in challenging the contract through legal action and public advocacy. **Foxglove** has led the "No Palantir in the NHS" campaign, raising alarms about vendor lock-in and a "rigged" procurement process.71 The  
  **Good Law Project** has focused on legal challenges to the contract's secrecy, successfully forcing the release of previously redacted documents.26 Meanwhile, patient data watchdogs like  
  **medConfidential** and investigative outlets such as **openDemocracy** have consistently warned that the project is repeating the mistakes of past failed NHS data initiatives.13  
* **Public Protests:** The campaign has also manifested in direct action. Health workers, patients, and activists have organised protests, including blockading the entrance to NHS England's headquarters in London, holding placards with slogans such as "No Palantir in the NHS" and "Palantir aids apartheid," a direct reference to the company's work with the Israeli military.9

### **Losing the Front Line: Resistance from Within the NHS**

Perhaps the most significant threat to the FDP's success comes not from external pressure but from widespread scepticism and outright resistance within the NHS itself. Despite a top-down push for adoption from NHS England leadership, many local trusts and data professionals on the ground remain unconvinced and unwilling to implement the platform.  
An investigation by Corporate Watch, based on a series of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests sent to 205 NHS trusts in April 2025, revealed a startling lack of uptake. The findings indicated that **more than half of trusts were not actively using the FDP**.82 The resistance is often based on practical and technical grounds. Multiple trusts, including those in Leeds and Greater Manchester, have stated that adopting the FDP would be a  
**"retrograde step"** and that they would **"lose functionality rather than gain it"** compared to their more advanced, locally-developed data systems.28 The Greater Manchester Integrated Care Board, for instance, concluded that its existing analytics stack was years ahead of Palantir's offerings and that forced adoption would be "time-consuming".82  
This sentiment was formalised in February 2025, when the **Chief Data and Analytics Officers Network (CDAON)**—a body representing the NHS's own senior data experts—sent an open letter to Ming Tang, the FDP's Senior Responsible Owner. The letter raised serious concerns about "programme drift," the imposition of a single software platform over true interoperability, and unclear future costs for maintenance and adoption.82 This amounts to a formal rebellion from the very experts tasked with implementing the system. Palantir UK's executive vice president, Louis Mosley, has dismissed such opposition as "ideology over patient interest".74 This framing, however, ignores the technical and operational legitimacy of the internal resistance. The project is not just facing a public relations crisis; it is facing a user acceptance crisis, driven by expert opinion that the product is not fit for purpose.

### **The Public's Trust Deficit: Echoes of Past Failures**

The FDP is haunted by the ghosts of previous large-scale NHS data projects that collapsed under the weight of public mistrust. The most notable failures, **care.data** (2014-2016) and the **General Practice Data for Planning and Research (GPDPR)** programme (2021), were both shelved after widespread public backlash.11  
These initiatives failed because of a perceived lack of public consultation, poorly communicated objectives, and deep-seated concerns about the involvement of private companies in handling sensitive health records. In the case of care.data, these fears led to over 1.2 million patients opting out of data sharing, which degraded the quality of the dataset to the point of being unusable.11 Campaigners and medical leaders warn that the FDP is destined for the same fate, with the controversial choice of Palantir acting as a powerful catalyst for patient mistrust.13  
Compounding this issue is the confusion over patient choice. NHS England's official position is that the national data opt-out does not apply to data processed within the FDP for the purpose of "direct care".76 While technically correct under current rules, the inability for patients to opt out of having their data managed by a system run by a company like Palantir is a major point of contention and is likely to further erode public confidence.5

## **Part V: The Bigger Picture and Long-Term Stakes**

The Federated Data Platform contract is more than an isolated procurement; it is a landmark event that sits at the intersection of several powerful trends: the privatisation of critical public infrastructure, the financialization of health data, and the strategic risk of ceding national sovereignty to transnational technology corporations. The long-term stakes for the NHS and the UK public are immense.

### **The New Data Colonialism? Public Service Privatisation in the Digital Age**

The Palantir-NHS deal exemplifies a broader global trend where public services are becoming increasingly dependent on a handful of powerful, often US-based, technology firms for their core digital architecture.88 This shift raises fundamental questions about national data sovereignty and public accountability. While the UK has opted for a model that outsources its central health data platform to a private consortium, other countries have pursued different strategies:

* **France's Health Data Hub (HDH):** This is structured as a public interest group that brings together public sector stakeholders to provide unified access to health data. However, it has faced similar sovereignty concerns over its initial decision to use Microsoft for cloud hosting, highlighting the pervasive influence of US tech giants.89  
* **Finland's National Strategy:** Finland represents a more state-led approach, with a fully digitalised health system governed by a strong legal framework for the secondary use of data, all managed by a national data permit authority called Findata.91  
* **Canada's Digital Health and Discovery Platform (DHDP):** This pan-Canadian initiative is led by a non-profit research institute, focusing on creating a collaborative data ecosystem for health and AI research rather than a single, centrally procured platform.93

This trend is not just about technology; it is about finance. The acquisition in May 2024 of **Civica**, a major UK provider of software to the public sector (including healthcare), by the private equity behemoth **Blackstone** for a reported $2.5 billion, underscores the intense financial interest in this market.94 The FDP contract is a key part of this wider financialization of public digital infrastructure, where critical national assets are becoming vehicles for private investment and profit.

### **The Risk of Irreversible Lock-In: A One-Way Street**

One of the most significant long-term risks identified by critics is that of **vendor lock-in**.11 Palantir's Foundry software is a proprietary platform. Once NHS data is integrated into its specific data model (or "ontology"), and clinical workflows and applications are built on top of it, migrating to an alternative system becomes extraordinarily difficult and expensive.95 This creates what is known as "data gravity"—a dependency that makes it almost impossible to leave.  
This is not a hypothetical concern. The UK's **National Data Guardian, Dr. Nicola Byrne**, explicitly warned NHS England about this danger during the procurement process. She noted that the consequences of lock-in can include "rising costs, no redress against inadequate performance, and prohibitive charges for changes," and stressed the need for reassurance that the NHS would "maintain control" and could terminate the partnership without compromising patient care or incurring significant costs.42 This strategic failure to invest in sovereign public capability, opting instead to rent critical infrastructure, creates a long-term dependency that shifts power from the public institution to the private vendor.

### **The End Game: A Single Patient Record and Permanent Dependency**

The FDP is not the final destination; it is the foundational layer for a much larger ambition. The UK government and NHS England have made it clear that the platform is the essential enabler for their long-term goal of creating a **"Single Patient Record"** for every citizen, accessible via the NHS App.57 This initiative, central to the government's 10-year health plan, would consolidate a patient's entire health history into one longitudinal record.98  
This long-term vision makes the initial choice of the FDP provider immensely consequential. The winner of the FDP contract is not just supplying a piece of software; they are building the "operating system for the health service" of the future.35 By securing this foundational role, Palantir is positioned to become the indispensable gatekeeper of the UK's entire national health data ecosystem for decades to come, creating a state of permanent dependency. The debate over the FDP is therefore a proxy war for the future soul of the NHS: whether it will remain a public service underpinned by public infrastructure, or evolve into a public service delivered via a platform controlled by private, transnational capital.

## **Conclusion & Recommendations**

The awarding of the £330 million Federated Data Platform contract to a consortium led by Palantir Technologies is the product of a deeply flawed and influenced process. It was enabled by a national crisis that allowed a pre-existing, high-level lobbying campaign to translate into a position of unassailable incumbency, bypassing normal standards of competition and transparency. The chosen vendor's corporate history, its work in state surveillance and military operations, and the stated ideology of its leadership are in direct conflict with the core values of the NHS.  
Consequently, the project faces a severe and growing crisis of confidence from clinicians, the NHS's own data experts, and the public, echoing the failures of previous national data initiatives. The contract introduces profound and potentially irreversible long-term risks of vendor lock-in, escalating costs, and the erosion of public control over a critical piece of national infrastructure. This is not merely a technology procurement; it is a high-stakes gamble with the future of the UK's most trusted public service and its most sensitive data.  
Based on this investigation, the following actions are recommended for policymakers, Parliament, and NHS England to mitigate these risks and restore public trust:

1. **Mandate Radical Transparency:** The full, unredacted FDP and PET contracts, including all annexes, schedules, and sub-contracting agreements, must be published immediately. A public dashboard should be established to track all spending under the contract in near-real time, providing a clear account of how taxpayer money is being used.  
2. **Establish Independent, Statutory Oversight:** An independent oversight body must be created with statutory powers, a dedicated budget, and robust representation from patient groups, clinicians, and independent technology and ethics experts. This body must have the authority to audit all aspects of the FDP's implementation—including data usage, security protocols, costs, and performance—and be required to report its findings directly to Parliament, not just to NHS England.  
3. **Develop and Publish a Viable Exit Strategy:** To counter the severe risk of vendor lock-in, the government must immediately commission and publish a clear, technically credible, and legally binding exit strategy. This strategy must detail how NHS data and all associated logic and applications can be fully migrated to an alternative platform in open, non-proprietary formats. Future development on the platform must mandate the use of open standards and APIs to ensure interoperability and prevent the creation of a closed ecosystem.  
4. **Invest in Sovereign Capability:** A fundamental strategic shift is required. A significant portion of future NHS digital transformation budgets must be redirected from procuring external software licences and consultancy services towards building a world-class, in-house digital, data, and technology workforce. The long-term goal should be the creation of a publicly owned and controlled data platform, an "NHS Digital Foundry," to develop and manage critical national health infrastructure as a public asset.  
5. **Reform Procurement and "Revolving Door" Rules:** The rules governing the movement of personnel between senior public sector roles and major private suppliers must be strengthened. A mandatory "cooling-off" period of at least five years should be introduced for very senior officials in sensitive areas like health data and defence before they can take up employment or advisory roles with companies that were major suppliers to their former department. Furthermore, public procurement regulations must be reformed to explicitly mitigate the incumbent advantage gained by suppliers during emergency situations, ensuring that crisis-driven contracts do not become a pathway to non-competitive market capture.
