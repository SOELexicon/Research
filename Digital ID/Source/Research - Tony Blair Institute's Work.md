# **The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change: A Global Consultancy for Power**

### **Executive Summary**

The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) has rapidly established itself as a formidable and unique actor on the world stage. Operating at the intersection of policy, technology, and governance, it defies easy categorization. This report finds that TBI functions as a powerful hybrid organization—part think tank, part global consultancy, and part post-premiership foundation—fueled by substantial tech-sector philanthropy and operating at the highest levels of global power. Its stated mission is to help leaders "get things done" by providing hands-on support in strategy, policy, and delivery. This execution-focused model, combined with the personal brand and network of its founder, has enabled its expansion into over 45 countries.  
The institute's core policy thesis champions a "Reimagined State," a vision of technocratic governance where artificial intelligence, data centralization, and digital identity are the primary tools for transforming public services and driving economic growth. This agenda is propelled by a financial model heavily reliant on Oracle founder Larry Ellison, whose philanthropic contributions have underwritten TBI's explosive growth. This report analyzes the resulting dynamic, where the institute's policy advocacy often aligns with the commercial interests of its primary benefactor, particularly in the realms of digital health and AI. This alignment, alongside TBI's advisory work for controversial clients such as Saudi Arabia and its founder's high-profile role in sensitive geopolitical issues like postwar Gaza planning, creates a core tension. This tension between its stated not-for-profit mission and the persistent controversies surrounding its funding, influence, and policy positions defines the institute's complex identity and strategic impact.

## **I. The Institute's Architecture: Mission, Structure, and Global Footprint**

The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change has been constructed as a formidable global entity, distinct in its structure and operational capacity from traditional policy organizations. Its architecture combines a mission focused on implementation, a leadership structure built around its high-profile founder, and an operational scale that rivals major international consultancies.

### **The Stated Mission: "Turning Bold Ideas into Reality"**

The institute's official mandate is to be an active agent of change, not merely a source of commentary. TBI defines itself as a not-for-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to helping governments and leaders translate ambitious ideas into tangible outcomes.1 Its central value proposition is a hands-on, embedded approach. The organization's literature repeatedly emphasizes working "shoulder to shoulder" with leaders, providing practical, execution-focused support to turn political vision into reality.4 This focus on "delivery" and "getting things done" is a key differentiator, positioning the institute as a partner in implementation rather than an external observer. The overarching stated goal is to contribute to the development of "more open, inclusive and prosperous countries for people everywhere".2  
This operational philosophy suggests a model more aligned with management consulting than with academic research. While traditional think tanks primarily aim to influence policy debates from the outside through published research, TBI's language and structure point to a strategy of working from within government structures. The recruitment of "delivery practitioners" and "technology specialists" alongside policy experts underscores an investment in a service delivery infrastructure, not just a research apparatus.2 This framing is crucial for understanding its methods of influence and the nature of its relationships with client governments. An insider's description of the institute as a "McKinsey for world leaders" appears to be less a casual remark and more an accurate summary of its fundamental business model.5

### **Leadership and Governance: The Indelible Mark of the Founder**

The institute is fundamentally an extension of its founder's vision, network, and political brand. As Executive Chairman, Tony Blair provides the strategic direction, grounded in his belief that a country's capacity for transformational change is directly dependent on the "effectiveness of its leadership and governance".6 He leverages his personal relationships to engage with world leaders, granting the institute a level of access unavailable to most non-governmental organizations.  
While Blair provides the vision, the institute is managed by a professional executive team. Chief Executive Officer Catherine Rimmer has led the organization since its inception in 2016, overseeing its period of most significant growth and impact.6 The management board reflects TBI's global structure, with Managing Directors for key regions including Africa, the Americas, and Asia Pacific.6  
To further bolster its credibility and extend its reach, TBI employs a roster of high-profile Strategic Counsellors. This group includes former heads of state such as Sanna Marin, the former Prime Minister of Finland, and Matteo Renzi, the former Prime Minister of Italy, as well as senior military figures like General Sir Nick Carter, the former UK Chief of the Defence Staff.7 This cadre of experienced leaders provides the institute with invaluable strategic insight and reinforces its image as an organization that understands the practical realities of exercising power.

### **Operational Scale: Anatomy of a Global Policy Consultancy**

Underwritten by significant philanthropic investment, TBI has undergone a period of explosive growth. Its staff has expanded from a headcount of around 200 to nearly 900 individuals drawn from the public, private, and tech sectors.2 This diverse team, hailing from over 50 countries and speaking more than 45 languages, gives TBI a truly global talent pool.2  
The institute's operational footprint is vast and expanding. As of 2024, it is active in over 45 countries, managing more than 150 projects for governments whose populations collectively exceed one billion people.2 This work is supported by a sophisticated global operating model. In addition to its London headquarters, TBI has established fully operational regional headquarters in Singapore (for the Asia-Pacific), Abu Dhabi (for the Middle East and North Africa), and Nairobi (for Africa), with further plans for a hub in Washington, D.C., to support the Americas.9 A representative office in Brussels ensures engagement with European Union institutions.9 This physical infrastructure is a clear investment in a long-term, global service delivery capability, cementing its status as a permanent fixture in the international advisory landscape.

## **II. The "Reimagined State": Core Policy Theses and Strategic Focus**

The intellectual and policy agenda of the Tony Blair Institute is not a broad ideological platform but a highly focused and prescriptive advocacy for a specific, technology-centric model of governance. This vision, termed the "Reimagined State," posits technology not merely as a tool for efficiency but as the fundamental organizing principle for modern government.

### **The Primacy of Technology: AI, Digital ID, and the Future of Governance**

A core belief animating TBI's work is that the "greatest opportunity for governments today is the technological revolution".4 Technology is presented as the central, enabling force across all the institute's advisory pillars: strategy, policy, and delivery.1 This conviction is operationalized through its central thesis of the "Reimagined State," a vision for a government that actively harnesses artificial intelligence and data to become more "adaptive, innovative," and responsive to citizen needs.9 This focus is not theoretical; in 2023, technology-related support was a component of TBI's work in 62% of its portfolio countries.9  
A consistent and foundational policy proposal within this framework is the widespread implementation of national Digital ID systems. TBI argues that a secure, universal digital identity is a cornerstone of a modern state, enabling personalized, proactive public services, enhancing national security, and streamlining citizen-state interactions.10 To bolster this case, the institute has commissioned public opinion research in the UK, which it reports shows majority support (62%) for the concept.11 This consistent promotion of a specific technological solution across various policy domains reveals a worldview where governance challenges are framed primarily as technical and logistical problems, for which data architecture and AI-driven automation are the optimal solutions.

### **Key Policy Pillars**

The institute's work is organized around several core policy pillars, which are reflected in the thematic categories of its published "Insights" and reports. These include Tech & Digitalisation, Economic Prosperity, Geopolitics & Security, Politics & Governance, Climate & Energy, and Public Services.10

* **Public Services:** TBI advocates for the radical, technology-driven reform of public services. In the context of the UK's National Health Service (NHS), its proposals include using AI to enhance productivity and creating new fiscal models to shift spending from reactive sickness care towards proactive prevention.12 A central plank of this is the creation of a "National Data Trust," a public-private entity designed to manage and leverage the UK's health data for research and improved care delivery.14  
* **Economic Prosperity:** A significant focus of TBI's international work is addressing systemic barriers to economic growth, particularly in the developing world. Its reports propose "radical-yet-practical" solutions, such as a new debt relief architecture for African nations designed to break the cycle of high interest payments and underinvestment.10  
* **Politics & Governance:** The institute produces analysis on the shifting dynamics of Western politics, arguing that a widespread public sense of national decline and distrust in the establishment is fueling populist movements.16 It contends that mainstream parties must adopt a strategy of "disruptive delivery"—using technology to achieve visible, transformative results—to win back disillusioned voters.10

### **Case Study Analysis: Deconstructing TBI's Reports**

An examination of TBI's flagship reports reveals a clear and consistent methodology.

* **UK Public Service Reform:** Reports such as "Disruptive Delivery: Reversing Decline, Transforming Britain" and "Preparing the NHS for the AI Era" follow a distinct pattern.12 They begin by identifying and amplifying a public sentiment of "decline," diagnosing the problem as a failure of the state's outdated operating model. The proposed solution is invariably technology-centric, presenting AI, data interoperability, and Digital ID as the essential pathways to transformation and renewal.  
* **"A New Debt Deal for Africa":** This report exemplifies TBI's approach to global challenges.15 It identifies a complex, systemic problem—the punitive interest rates that trap African nations in a cycle of debt. It then proposes a bold, structured solution: a $100 billion Debt-Swap Facility that links access to lower-cost financing with measurable improvements in public financial management. This is framed as a mutually beneficial arrangement that enhances governance, reduces risk for creditors, and frees up fiscal space for development, thereby presenting a technocratic solution to a deeply political problem.

Across these disparate policy areas, the proposed solutions consistently draw from the same toolkit. This promotion of a singular vision—the "Reimagined State"—is not a neutral offering of options but a blueprint for a state architected around specific technology platforms. This preference for technical solutions potentially downplays the complexities of political negotiation, social context, and ideological debate inherent in public policy.

## **III. Financial Underpinnings and Strategic Alliances**

The Tony Blair Institute's rapid global expansion and operational intensity are powered by a financial engine of considerable scale, characterized by a heavy reliance on a key tech-sector benefactor and strategic engagement with controversial state clients.

### **The Ellison Endowment: How Oracle's Founder Bankrolled a Global Expansion**

The institute's transformation from a modest post-premiership initiative into a global policy powerhouse is directly attributable to massive and sustained funding from Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder and executive chairman of the technology firm Oracle.8 Financial disclosures reveal that Ellison, primarily through the Larry Ellison Foundation, invested $130 million in TBI between 2021 and 2023, with a further $218 million pledged since that time.8  
This extraordinary influx of capital was the direct catalyst for TBI's operational surge. It enabled the institute to rapidly scale its headcount from approximately 200 to nearly 900, recruiting top-tier talent from management consulting, Silicon Valley, and senior government roles.8 This funding has not only expanded TBI's capacity but has also fundamentally shaped its strategic orientation, providing it with the resources to establish a global network of offices and embed advisory teams within governments worldwide.

### **Analysis of the 2023 Financials: Rapid Growth and an Investment-Driven Deficit**

The institute's 2023 financial statements paint a picture of an organization in a phase of aggressive, investment-fueled expansion.9

* **Turnover:** Consolidated turnover reached $145.3 million, a significant 20% increase over the previous year, reflecting growing demand for its advisory services.  
* **Expenses:** Consolidated operating expenses surged by 60% to $152.7 million. This dramatic increase was attributed primarily to higher staff costs associated with the expanded workforce and substantial investment in establishing its new regional headquarters.  
* **Deficit:** Consequently, the institute recorded a net deficit of $2.2 million for the year. This was a marked shift from the $16.8 million surplus recorded in 2022 and was explicitly framed by the organization as a strategic choice to make upfront investments in its global structure and new projects.  
* **Assets:** Despite the operating deficit, TBI's financial position remained robust. As of the end of 2023, the group held a net asset position of $37.4 million and reported healthy cash balances of $38.0 million, indicating a strong foundation for continued operations.

The high operating costs underscored by these figures reveal why TBI is structurally dependent on mega-donors. An expenditure level of over $150 million annually cannot be sustained by small-scale philanthropy, making the financial relationship with figures like Larry Ellison not merely beneficial but essential to its operating model.

| Metric | FY 2023 | FY 2022 | Year-over-Year Change |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Consolidated Turnover | $145.3 million | \~$121.1 million\* | \+20% |  |
| Consolidated Operating Expenses | $152.7 million | \~$95.4 million\* | \+60% |  |
| Net Result (Surplus/Deficit) | ($2.2 million) | $16.8 million | \-$19.0 million |  |

| Cash Balances | $38.0 million | N/A | N/A |  |
| \*Note: 2022 figures are calculated based on the percentage changes provided in the 2023 report.9 |  |  |  |  |

### **Controversial Clients and Donors: The Saudi Arabia Relationship**

Alongside its reliance on tech philanthropy, TBI has faced persistent criticism for its advisory work with, and acceptance of funding from, governments with poor human rights records, most notably Saudi Arabia.5 Reports confirmed that the institute continued its financial relationship with Saudi Arabia even after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a decision that drew widespread condemnation.5  
Tony Blair has publicly defended this engagement, employing a pragmatic argument that avoiding work in all countries with human rights challenges would severely limit the institute's reach and impact.5 The institute has stated that funding received from a subsidiary of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group was specifically to support its work on "modernisation and reform" within the kingdom.18 Nevertheless, this relationship remains a significant source of reputational risk and fuels accusations that the institute prioritizes access and funding over its stated values.  
The institute's financial structure creates a powerful feedback loop. The primary funder, Larry Ellison, is the head of a global technology giant with significant commercial interests in AI, cloud computing, and health data. In 2022, Oracle solidified its focus on digital health with the $28 billion acquisition of the healthcare IT company Cerner.5 Concurrently, TBI's policy reports consistently and forcefully advocate for the mass digitization of health records and the creation of national health data systems—an agenda that critics note "happens to tally with the corporate interests of one of its biggest donors".5 While the institute maintains that donations are "ringfenced" and that no conflict of interest exists, the dynamic suggests a sophisticated form of influence.5 Rather than a direct quid pro quo, the funding supports an organization that shares and promotes a technocratic worldview. The outcome is the active shaping of a favorable policy environment for the very technologies and systems that Oracle is commercially positioned to provide, blurring the line between philanthropic mission and strategic market development.

## **IV. Influence and Controversy: A Critical Examination**

The Tony Blair Institute's unique operational model, financial underpinnings, and proximity to power have made it a subject of intense scrutiny and controversy. The criticisms leveled against it are not incidental but stem directly from the core attributes that also make it effective: its reliance on a major corporate donor, its engagement with contentious geopolitical actors, and its founder's indelible public legacy.

### **Allegations of Conflict of Interest: The Oracle-AI-Health Data Nexus**

The most persistent criticism targets the perceived conflict of interest arising from TBI's relationship with its primary donor, Larry Ellison of Oracle.5 Critics allege that the institute functions as a vehicle to advance the corporate interests of its backers. This charge is most pointed in relation to TBI's strong advocacy for the digitization of public services, particularly healthcare.  
The institute's push for digital health records and AI-driven healthcare solutions is seen by skeptics as directly serving the business strategy of Oracle, especially following its multi-billion-dollar acquisition of health IT firm Cerner.5 While TBI formally denies any conflict of interest, it has acknowledged that part of its role involves connecting public officials with private sector companies that it believes can help deliver on its recommended policy changes.5 This positions the institute as a powerful and potentially biased intermediary, capable of shaping both government policy and procurement decisions in a manner that benefits its financial patrons.

### **Geopolitical Maneuvering: Blair's Contentious Role in Postwar Gaza Planning**

Leveraging his long and complex history of engagement with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Tony Blair has emerged as a "key player" in high-level discussions regarding the post-war governance and reconstruction of Gaza.20 This involvement is deeply controversial.  
To his supporters, including many in Israel, he is a known quantity and a trusted broker who can navigate complex diplomatic terrain.20 However, for many Palestinians and other observers, his role is viewed with profound suspicion. His legacy as a co-architect of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, based on flawed intelligence, and a perceived career-long bias towards Israeli positions, severely undermines his credibility as a neutral arbiter.20  
The institute itself has been drawn into the controversy. TBI staff reportedly participated in meetings concerning postwar plans, including a highly contentious proposal that involved the potential relocation of a large number of Gazans.18 TBI has since sought to distance itself from these more extreme proposals, stating that its staff participated only in a "listening mode".20 Nonetheless, the episode highlights the risks of operating in such a volatile geopolitical arena, where association alone can generate significant reputational damage.

### **The Climate Policy "Reset": Backlash and Accusations of Fossil Fuel Proximity**

In 2025, TBI sparked a major backlash with the publication of a report calling for a "reset" of global climate policy. In the report's foreword, Tony Blair argued that any climate strategy based on a short-term phase-out of fossil fuels was "doomed to fail".23  
The intervention was immediately and fiercely condemned by leading climate experts. Nicholas Stern, author of the landmark Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, labeled the TBI report "muddled and misleading," accusing it of downplaying climate science and lacking a necessary sense of urgency.24 Critics were quick to draw a direct line between this policy stance and TBI's ongoing advisory work for major petrostates, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, suggesting the institute's climate agenda was compromised by the interests of its clients.19 The episode damaged TBI's standing on a critical global issue and reinforced the perception that its policy positions are susceptible to the influence of its funders and clients.

### **Methodological Scrutiny: The AI Report and Questions of Academic Rigor**

The institute's credibility as a rigorous research organization has also been challenged. A TBI report which argued that AI could perform a large percentage of public-sector work, leading to massive productivity gains, was met with "ridicule" from technology commentators due to its flawed methodology.26  
The report's researchers used the AI model ChatGPT-4 to analyze some 20,000 job tasks to determine their suitability for automation. Critics derided this approach as "outsourcing" the fundamental work of a think tank and lambasted its lack of scientific validity, with one expert comparing the method to "shaking a Magic 8 ball and writing down the answers it displays".26 This controversy raised serious questions about whether TBI's research is designed to produce objective analysis or to generate headline-grabbing conclusions that support its pre-existing, technology-centric agenda.  
The recurring pattern of these controversies reveals that TBI's primary product is not just policy analysis, but access and influence. Its value to both clients and donors lies in its unique ability to operate within the corridors of power, directly shaping agendas at the highest levels. In Gaza, Blair is not an academic observer but an active "key player" in diplomatic negotiations.20 On climate, the institute's intervention was timed and framed to directly impact the national political debate.24 With technology, TBI does not just research; it actively connects governments to private sector partners.5 This focus on direct intervention is the institute's greatest asset, but it is also the source of its most significant ethical challenges, as its actions are constantly scrutinized for alignment with the interests of its funders, its clients, or its founder's personal political projects.

| Category of Criticism | Core Allegation | Key Actors / Subjects | Supporting Snippets |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Conflict of Interest (Funding)** | TBI's policy advocacy, particularly on AI and digital health, directly aligns with the commercial interests of its main donor, Oracle. | Larry Ellison, Oracle, Cerner, NHS Digitalisation | 5 |
| **Geopolitical Controversy** | Tony Blair and TBI are playing a biased and unwelcome role in postwar Gaza planning, tainted by Blair's legacy in Iraq. | Gaza, Israel, Palestinian Authority, Donald Trump | 20 |
| **Controversial Clients** | The institute accepts funding from and provides advisory services to authoritarian regimes, notably Saudi Arabia. | Saudi Arabia, UAE, Azerbaijan | 5 |
| **Policy Stance (Climate)** | TBI is undermining urgent climate action by arguing against a rapid fossil fuel phase-out, a position that benefits its petrostate clients. | Net Zero, Fossil Fuels, COP28/29 | 23 |
| **Methodological Rigor** | The institute has produced research (e.g., on AI's impact on jobs) using flawed and unscientific methods, undermining its credibility. | Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT-4, Public Sector Jobs | 26 |
| **Political Influence (UK)** | TBI is accused of wielding undue influence over the UK Labour Party, promoting a "billionaire-bankrolled" corporate agenda. | Keir Starmer, Labour Party | 5 |

## **V. TBI in Context: A New Breed of Think Tank?**

To fully understand the Tony Blair Institute, it must be situated within the broader ecosystem of policy and advisory organizations. Its structure and methods suggest that it represents a new, hybrid model that transcends traditional categories, combining elements of a think tank, a management consultancy, and a presidential foundation.

### **Beyond Traditional Policy Research: A "McKinsey for World Leaders"**

TBI's operational model diverges sharply from that of conventional think tanks. Organizations like the Brookings Institution have historically focused on conducting in-depth, academic-style research and contributing to public debate through publications and events.27 Their influence is indirect, aimed at shaping the intellectual climate in which policy is made.  
In contrast, TBI's model is predicated on direct, embedded implementation.4 Its primary function is not to publish for a general audience but to provide bespoke advice and execution support directly to heads of government and their senior teams. This makes the "McKinsey for world leaders" label a particularly apt description of its core function, highlighting its focus on client service and project delivery within government.5

### **Comparative Analysis: TBI vs. Other Models**

When compared to other types of policy organizations, TBI's unique characteristics become even clearer.

* **Advocacy Tanks:** While TBI certainly advocates for a specific worldview—one of technocratic, market-oriented centrism—it differs from explicitly partisan "advocacy tanks" like The Heritage Foundation in the United States.29 Heritage was created to serve a domestic political movement and provide a comprehensive policy agenda for a specific party (the Republicans).27 TBI's clientele, by contrast, is global and encompasses leaders from across a much wider (though generally centrist) political spectrum.  
* **Presidential Foundations:** TBI shares the high-profile brand of its founder with organizations established by other former leaders, such as the Clinton Foundation and the Carter Center.30 However, there are crucial functional differences. The Carter Center, for example, has focused on specific, tangible humanitarian goals like election monitoring and disease eradication.31 TBI's ambition is far broader and more systemic: to reshape the very machinery and operating philosophy of government itself. It functions less as a legacy project dedicated to specific causes and more as an active, ongoing global consultancy.

This analysis reveals that TBI is not just another think tank or foundation. It is an innovative hybrid that fuses the intellectual branding and policy-shaping ambition of a think tank with the client-focused, execution-driven model of a top-tier consultancy. This is then amplified by the unparalleled access and convening power that can only be provided by a former world leader. This hybridity is the core of its design, allowing it to operate in the influential gray area between public policy analysis and private advisory services. It is this unique positioning that is the source of both its effectiveness and the persistent controversies that surround it.

### **The Blair Legacy and the Future of the Institute**

The institute remains inextricably linked to the person, political philosophy, and deeply controversial legacy of Tony Blair. His role in the Iraq War, his "New Labour" ideology, and his subsequent lucrative private sector work form the unavoidable backdrop to all of TBI's activities.5 This connection is a double-edged sword: it provides the extraordinary access that makes the institute so influential, but it also serves as a perpetual lightning rod for criticism and suspicion. A critical question for the organization's long-term sustainability is whether it can successfully institutionalize its model and build a brand that can outlive its founder's personal influence, or if it is entirely dependent on his unique network and public profile.

## **VI. Synthesis and Strategic Outlook**

The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change has, in a remarkably short period, engineered a position of significant influence in global affairs. Its rapid ascent is a direct consequence of an innovative and potent organizational model that fuses the functions of a policy think tank, an elite strategy consultancy, and a high-level diplomatic entity. This hybrid structure, underwritten by the immense financial resources of Silicon Valley philanthropy, has allowed TBI to scale globally and embed itself within the decision-making processes of governments worldwide.  
The institute's central mission—to advance a technocratic vision of a "Reimagined State"—is both its greatest strength and its most significant vulnerability. By championing AI, Digital ID, and data-driven governance, TBI has positioned itself at the forefront of the defining policy conversation of the 21st century. It offers a clear, confident, and prescriptive agenda to leaders grappling with public distrust and the challenges of a rapidly changing world. This clarity of purpose has proven highly attractive to a global clientele seeking "radical-yet-practical" solutions.  
However, the very factors that fuel its influence also generate substantial reputational and ethical risks. The institute's financial dependence on a key figure from the technology industry creates an unavoidable perception of a conflict of interest, where its policy advocacy appears to pave the way for the commercial products of its benefactor. This is compounded by its willingness to engage with and accept funding from authoritarian regimes, which critics argue compromises its stated commitment to open and inclusive societies. Furthermore, the personal legacy of its founder, particularly his role in the Iraq War, casts a long shadow, undermining his credibility as a neutral broker in sensitive geopolitical conflicts.  
Looking forward, TBI's strategic challenge is to navigate these inherent tensions. Its influence is undeniable, and it is set to remain a key player in shaping the global discourse on the future of governance. Yet, its long-term legitimacy will depend on its ability to demonstrate that its advice serves a genuine public good, independent of the commercial interests of its donors and the political baggage of its founder. The trajectory of the Tony Blair Institute will therefore serve as a critical case study in the evolving nature of power and influence, highlighting the profound questions of transparency, accountability, and democracy that arise when private wealth and post-political ambition converge to reshape the modern state.
