**Significance:** Six versions over 14 months shows this was a living, actively managed document

## Significance

### PRIMARY SOURCE EVIDENCE FOR:
✅ **Centralized Information Control** - Mandatory FOI referral to NPCC
✅ **Strategic Publication Delays** - Section 22 exemption to defer disclosure
✅ **Cross-Force Coordination** - All Home Office forces coordinated through NPCC
✅ **Information Management Strategy** - "Sterile period" before publication
✅ **Transparency Restrictions** - Delayed publication until "July 2022" (2+ years)

### VALIDATES ETHICAL APPROACH UK FINDINGS:
> "Information control, top-down communication centralisation"
> "Strategic communication units"
> "Institutional resistance to transparency"

## Background (from Document)

### WHO Declaration
**January 30, 2020:** World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 outbreak a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern"

### Operation Talla Establishment
> "A national operation to respond to lead the police response has been established called **Operation Talla** led by NPCC Chair Martin Hewitt National Policing (NPCC)"

**Leadership:** NPCC Chair Martin Hewitt

## Freedom of Information Act Strategy

### Mandatory Referral Process

**Key Provision:**
> "All FOI requests capturing information relating to the Coronavirus, are until further notice, considered to be a **mandatory referral to the NPCC Freedom of Information and Data Protection Unit (NPFDU)** as per College of Policing Authorised Professional Practice (APP), a process all chief officers are signed up to."

**Implications:**
- ✅ CENTRALIZED CONTROL: Individual forces cannot independently respond to COVID-19 FOI requests
- ✅ NATIONAL COORDINATION: NPCC consults stakeholders and provides "national corporate view"
- ✅ LOCAL OVERRIDE: Forces supplement with "local factors" but NPCC provides baseline position
- ✅ ALL CHIEFS SIGNED UP: Not optional - mandated process

### Consultation Requirements

**Process:**
1. Force receives COVID-19-related FOI request
2. Force **must** refer to NPFDU
3. NPFDU consults "all necessary stakeholders"
4. NPFDU provides "national corporate view"
5. Force makes final decision "based on a national corporate view"
6. **NPCC communications team informed of every request**
7. Local media/communications team also informed

**NCND (Neither Confirm Nor Deny):**
> "The application of NCND will be strictly maintained wherever possible"

**BUT:**
> "Cannot be considered as a blanket approach... must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in line with the public interest arguments"

### Section 22 Exemption Strategy

**What is Section 22?**
Exemption for information "held with a view to future publication"

**NPCC Strategy:**
> "The NPCC FOI publication strategy has been formulated in order to allow any public authorities to take advantage, when appropriate, of the exemption within FOI legislation found at Section 22."

**Critical Requirement:**
> "Section 22 may not be used... after the request for information is received. **The key to it is that the decision to publish must have been made prior to any request for the information being received.**"

**NPCC Solution:**
This publication strategy **pre-commits** to future publication, allowing all forces to claim Section 22 exemption

**Transferability:**
> "This publication strategy is therefore **transferable between all relevant parties.**"

### Stated Benefits of Section 22 Strategy

**From Document:**

1. **Resource Management:**
   > "Dealing with requests for certain data whilst the negotiations are ongoing can be complex and resource intensive. The exemption allows for the removal of predicted demand."

2. **Prevent "Piecemeal Disclosures":**
   > "Random piecemeal disclosures may in fact **damage strategic aims.**"

3. **Control Narrative:**
   > "There will also be an appetite from the news media and others to gain knowledge and data via FOI, and publication will provide for transparency and accessibility to information which is not sensitive for operational or other reasons."

4. **"Sterile Period":**
   > "The application of this exemption also allows a **sterile period, prior to publication**, where all the stakeholders are able to engage, ensuring the final publication meets the full needs of the public and the authorities involved."

5. **Prevent "Harm":**
   > "This coordinated approach to publication **mitigates any harm that may be caused by random incomplete information entering the public domain.**"

### Critical Success Factor

**Maintaining Exemption Integrity:**
> "What is critical to the success of this strategy is that any rationale for not complying with the Section 22 approach is recorded so that a precedent is not set which undermines other PAs ability to engage the exemption."

**Translation:** All forces must use Section 22 consistently or the strategy collapses

## Data Protection Act (DPA)

**Subject Access Requests:**
> "A relevant PA may also receive a request under subject access for personal information under the DPA. The main difference between this and FOI is that a release of personal information is not a release to the world in general."

**Exclusions:**
> "The information itself is also subject to a range of exclusions to disclosure, primarily law enforcement."

## Analysis and Implications

### Centralized Information Control CONFIRMED

**Ethical Approach UK Finding:**
> "Information control, top-down communication centralisation"

**NPCC Document Confirms:**
- ✅ Mandatory referral of ALL COVID-19 FOI requests to NPCC
- ✅ "National corporate view" provided to all forces
- ✅ Strategic use of Section 22 to delay disclosures
- ✅ "Sterile period" to control information release
- ✅ All forces must coordinate to maintain strategy

### Strategic Aims Protected

**Document States:**
> "Random piecemeal disclosures may in fact **damage strategic aims.**"

**Questions:**
- What "strategic aims" beyond policing response?
- Why would transparency "damage" legitimate policing aims?
- Aligns with Ethical Approach UK assessment of objectives beyond pandemic management

### "Harm" from Transparency

**Document States:**
> "This coordinated approach to publication mitigates any **harm that may be caused by random incomplete information entering the public domain.**"

**Questions:**
- What "harm" from public information?
- Who is harmed by transparency?
- Suggests information control for narrative management, not just operational security

### "Sterile Period" for Stakeholder Coordination

**Document States:**
> "Allows a sterile period, prior to publication, where all the stakeholders are able to engage"

**Questions:**
- Who are "stakeholders" beyond police forces?
- What coordination needed before public disclosure?
- Suggests multi-agency alignment before transparency

### Publication Delays: July 2022

**Significance:**
- Most data delayed until "conclusion of Operation Talla"
- "No later than July 2022" = 2+ years after Operation Talla began
- Some data "as and when risk diminishes" (no fixed date)
- Systematic delay of transparency about policing during pandemic

### Independent Ethics Committee

**Document References:**
> "Summary documents (outlining discussions and advice) and dilemmas given by the **Operation Talla Independent Ethics Committee**"

**Significance:**
- Ethics committee existence confirms institutional oversight
- But deliberations delayed until July 2022
- "Dilemmas" suggests ethical concerns arose
- No public transparency during operation

### ACRO Centralization Confirmed

**Document States:**
FPN data "not before conclusion of FPN processing by **ACRO**"

**Validates Ethical Approach UK Finding:**
> "The use of ACRO as a centralised FPN issuing agency underscores this transformation."

### NPCC Communications Team Loop

**Document Requires:**
> "The NPFDU will ensure that the NPCC communications team is informed of the request."

**Significance:**
- Communications team aware of ALL COVID-19 FOI requests
- Allows narrative management and media preparation
- Coordinated communications strategy

## Connections to Ethical Approach UK Investigation

### EA UK Finding #1: Information Control
**EA UK:**
> "Information control, top-down communication centralisation"

**NPCC Document Confirms:**
- Mandatory centralized FOI process
- "National corporate view" imposed
- Strategic delays via Section 22
- Communications team coordination

### EA UK Finding #2: Strategic Communication Units
**EA UK:**
> "Strategic communication units"

**NPCC Document Confirms:**
- NPCC communications team informed of all requests
- Local media/communications teams also involved
- Coordinated approach to information release

### EA UK Finding #3: Institutional Resistance to Transparency
**EA UK:**
> "Institutional resistance to transparency remains ongoing, despite legitimate FOI requests and public interest grounds."

**NPCC Document Confirms:**
- Systematic use of exemptions to delay disclosure
- Publication delayed 2+ years
- "Sterile period" to control information
- Prevent "random piecemeal disclosures"

### EA UK Conclusion Validated
**EA UK:**
> "Operation Talla was not merely a policing operation, but a structural reconfiguration of law enforcement under centralised, quasi-military coordination."

**NPCC Document Evidence:**
- National coordination structure
- Centralized decision-making (all FOIs to NPCC)
- Strategic information management
- Multi-agency stakeholder coordination
- Ethics committee oversight
- Delayed transparency mechanisms

## Legal and Democratic Implications

### FOI Legislation Intent vs. Practice

**FOI Act Intent:** Public right to access information from public authorities

**Operation Talla Practice:**
- Centralized gatekeeping
- Strategic delays (2+ years)
- "Sterile period" for coordination
- Narrative control prioritized

### Public Interest Test Concerns

**Section 22 Requirement:** Subject to public interest test

**Document Approach:**
> "Must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis"

**BUT:**
- Publication strategy pre-commits to delays
- "Strategic aims" protected over transparency
- "Harm" from public information assumed

### Accountability Implications

**Delayed Oversight:**
- Financial data: Not until July 2022
- Ethics Committee dilemmas: Not until July 2022
- Mutual aid: Not until July 2022
- PPE procurement: Not until July 2022

**Effect:** Real-time democratic accountability impossible
