# Source - Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry Testimonies 2023-2024

## Overview
The Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry is described as "the world's only official COVID-19 inquiry to reveal the truth about what happened during lockdown hearing from families first hand." The inquiry heard harrowing testimonies from October 2023 through May 2024 documenting systematic failures in elderly care during COVID-19 lockdowns.

## Key Details
- **Period Covered:** October 2023 - May 2024
- **Location:** Scotland
- **Type:** Official government inquiry
- **Focus:** COVID-19 lockdown impacts, particularly on elderly and vulnerable populations
- **Documentation:** Citizen journalism compilation by biologyphenom (Substack)
- **Published:** May 13, 2024

## Media Coverage
- **Mainstream Media:** Poor coverage or ignored altogether
- **Alternative Media:** Largely ignored by so-called "alternative media"
- **TNT Radio:** Only alternative media platform showing interest and covering testimonies
- **MSPs (Members of Scottish Parliament):** Remained silent
- **Independent Coverage:** @TheRustler83 (X/Twitter), Freedom Podcast (Substack)

## Key Testimonies and Allegations

### Systematic Failures Documented
According to Shelagh McCall KC (King's Counsel):
> "Many families witnessed remotely a significant deterioration of their loved ones physical and mental health in lockdown that was NOTHING to do with COVID-19. Some suspect that their loved one was suffering from NEGLECT, DEHYDRATION and STARVATION."

### Categories of Alleged Harms
1. **Lockdown/Isolation** - Forced separation from families
2. **Medical Neglect** - Denial of proper medical care
3. **Deterioration** - Significant physical and mental health decline
4. **Starvation** - Suspected denial of adequate nutrition
5. **Dehydration** - Suspected denial of adequate fluids
6. **Forged Signature DNRs** - Do Not Resuscitate orders allegedly forged
7. **No Human Rights** - Systematic violations of basic rights
8. **No Power of Attorney** - Family legal authority ignored
9. **Missing Medical Records** - Documentation allegedly disappeared

### Public Reaction
**Amat (commenter):**
> "That was hard to watch, animals have more protection than what was given to the vulnerable elderly or people who had comprised health either mental or physical. The shocking thing in all of these people's testimonies is that it is obvious the system killed their relatives not the virus. They isolated them, denied relatives contact and when distress and anxiety set in because of neglect they quietened them down with end of life sedation. It is like listening to testimony coming out of Germany in the 1930s, utterly shocking and shameful."

**Martin Neil:**
> "Great compilation. I have no idea why this continues to be ignored by those who claim to be on our side. It is as if they want to deny the scale of iatrogenic harms in order to exaggerate the dangers from the virus."

## Mark Sexton's Response
Posted May 13, 2024:
> "If anyone out there still has any doubts about the mass murder of our beautiful elderly at the hands of doctors, nurses and carers all driven by government policy then look no further. 15 minutes of heartbreaking testimony evidenced at the Scottish Covid Inquiry. Thank you to Murray Ofthefamily Phillips for sending me this. I'm not ashamed to say my eyes filled up more than once watching this. Accountability MUST happen one way or another. God bless to all of the deceased and to their heartbroken loved ones who had to endure this nightmare."

## Pattern Analysis

### Iatrogenic Deaths (Treatment-Caused Deaths)
- Deaths attributed to COVID-19 may have been caused by:
  - Enforced isolation and neglect
  - Deliberate withholding of food and water
  - Inappropriate end-of-life sedation
  - DNR orders placed without proper consent
  - Denial of family advocacy and oversight

### Government Policy Implications
- Systematic implementation across care facilities
- Driven by government directives, not individual malpractice
- Protected by official COVID-19 emergency policies
- Families prevented from intervening or witnessing care

### Historical Parallels
Multiple commenters drew parallels to:
- Nazi Germany 1930s euthanasia programs
- Systematic dehumanization of vulnerable populations
- State-sanctioned elimination of "burdensome" individuals

## Significance

### Only Truth-Seeking Inquiry
- Described as world's only official COVID-19 inquiry hearing from families first-hand
- Contrasts with other inquiries focusing on policy justification rather than harms
- Provides documented evidence of systematic failures

### Media Blackout
- Mainstream media largely ignored testimonies
- Alternative media also silent (with exception of TNT Radio)
- Suggests coordinated suppression of evidence
- Citizen journalism filling critical gap

### Legal Implications
- Evidence of potential criminal neglect and manslaughter
- Forged DNR orders suggest fraud and unlawful killing
- Violations of human rights, power of attorney, medical ethics
- Potential for mass prosecution of healthcare workers and policy makers
