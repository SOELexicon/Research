# Source - DSIT Digital ID Design: Sex Matters Lobbying and Access (FOI Reveals)

## Summary
FOI disclosures show 2024–2025 correspondence between **DSIT** ministers/senior officials and **Sex Matters** during design of the UK digital identities framework. Records indicate repeated meetings (16 Jan 2025; 9 Apr 2025) and direct ministerial engagement, including guidance on how to feed into the cross‑government **Domain Expert Group on the Person Entity** (membership includes ONS, HMRC, Home Office, DWP, ODIA, MHCLG, Police Digital Service). Parallel requests by **Trans Actual** reportedly received lower‑level handling without equivalent access.

## Key Details
- Sex Matters pressed for deeming major datasets “unreliable” (HM Passport Office, DVLA, NHS, HMRC) for sex/gender fields
- Political advocacy included support from Lord Arbuthnot and correspondence to the Secretary of State
- Secretary of State letter (28 July 2025) confirms Domain Expert Group and route for representations
- Access asymmetry reported: Trans Actual correspondence handled by a junior minister; repeated meeting requests ignored
