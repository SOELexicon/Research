# Source - Jersey States Police Operation Talla Drink/Drive Procedure March 2020

## Document Details
- **Title:** Operation TALLA Coronavirus (COVID-19) Drink/Drive Procedure
- **Issuing Authority:** States of Jersey Police
- **Case Director Approval:** March 26, 2020
- **Release Method:** Freedom of Information Library
- **URL:** https://www.gov.je/freedom%20of%20information%20library/id%20foi%20%20detailed%20guidance_redacted%2020210920.pdf
- **Document Type:** Internal operational guidance (redacted FOI release)

## Significance
This is an **official primary source document** showing Operation Talla's implementation in Jersey (Channel Islands) and its direct impact on standard policing procedures. It provides concrete evidence of:
- Operation Talla's geographic scope beyond UK mainland
- Specific operational modifications during the operation
- Equipment availability decisions
- Acknowledged enforcement trade-offs
- Early pandemic timeline (March 26, 2020)

## Executive Summary (from Document)

> "During the time that Operation TALLA is in force it has been decided that the Road Side Screening devices and the Intoxilyzer device for breath analysis are not available for use. This is a lawful and entirely reasonable decision and the Road traffic (Jersey) Law 1956 (RT(J)L) makes provision for such an eventuality."

## Equipment Unavailability Decision

### Devices Deemed Unavailable
1. **Roadside screening devices** - for preliminary breath testing
2. **Intoxilyzer device** - for evidentiary breath analysis

### Stated Rationale
- Coronavirus (COVID-19) / Operation TALLA
- Described as "lawful and entirely reasonable decision"
- Legal provision existed under Road Traffic (Jersey) Law 1956

### Date of Implementation
March 26, 2020 (or earlier - this is the guidance issuance date)

## Legal Framework Affected

### Article 29 RT(J)L - Roadside Screening
**Normal Use:** Screening device indicates if person may be over prescribed alcohol limit

**Operation TALLA Status:**
> "The use of the screening device is covered under Article 29 of the RT(J)L and for the time being can be considered to be unenforceable."

### Article 30 RT(J)L - Specimen Provision
**Provision:** Article 30(3)(b) provides for situations where breath specimens cannot be obtained

**Operation TALLA Adaptation:** Blood or urine specimens required instead of breath analysis

## Modified Enforcement Procedures

### Arrest Without Screening Test

**Requirement for Arrest (without device):**
- Clear signs of alcoholic intoxication required
- Subjective assessment by officer based on "observation and experience"
- More than admissions and smell of intoxicants needed

**Observable Signs Required:**
- Slurred speech
- Unsteadiness
- Difficulty focusing eyes
- Classic symptoms of alcoholic intoxication

**Officer Authority:**
> "Police officers are acknowledged to have relevant experience regarding drunkenness."

### Station Procedure Modifications

**Form CJU 24A Modifications:**
- **A1:** Next to SCREENING TEST write **'Unavailable'**
- **A8:** Mark device availability as **NO** with reason **"Coronavirus (COVID-19)"**

**Specimen Collection:**
- Blood or urine required instead of breath
- Forensic Medical Examiner (FME) called for blood specimen
- FME NOT asked to offer opinion on suspect's condition
- "This procedure is in lieu of the Intoxilyzer procedure"

**Evidence Timing:**
> "The evidence then being obtained through analysis at a later date."

## Acknowledged Consequences

### Enforcement Capability Reduction

**Official Acknowledgment:**
> "The lack of the ability to screen test suspects or drivers involved in collisions or committing traffic offences will result in some drivers evading detection of prescribed limit offences. **That will be unavoidable during this period.**"

**Implications:**
- Reduced ability to detect drink driving
- Some offenders will evade detection
- Trade-off accepted as necessary during Operation TALLA
- Enforcement effectiveness deliberately reduced

### Offences Still Enforceable
- Article 28 RT(J)L: Driving over prescribed limit
- Article 27 RT(J)L: Driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs
- Arrests still possible based on officer observation

## Analysis and Significance

### Primary Source Value
✅ Official police operational guidance
✅ Internal document released via FOI
✅ Shows actual implementation of Operation Talla decisions
✅ Documents equipment unavailability rationale
✅ Provides specific date (March 26, 2020)
✅ Demonstrates geographic scope (Jersey/Channel Islands)

### Operation Talla Impact Evidence

**Confirms:**
1. Operation Talla directly modified standard policing procedures
2. Equipment decisions made centrally (not local discretion)
3. Legal frameworks adapted for Operation Talla
4. Enforcement trade-offs accepted and documented
5. "Lawful and entirely reasonable" framing of restrictions

### Decision-Making Framework

**Characteristics:**
- Decision characterized as "lawful and entirely reasonable"
- No detailed health/safety justification provided
- Existing legal provisions utilized
- Consequences acknowledged but accepted
- Timeline: very early in pandemic (late March 2020)

### Geographic Scope Implications

**Jersey Implementation Confirms:**
- Operation Talla extended beyond UK mainland
- Channel Islands coordinated with UK policing response
- Standardized approach across British policing jurisdictions
- "Operation TALLA" terminology used consistently

## Questions Raised

### Equipment Unavailability Rationale
**Document States:** "Lawful and entirely reasonable decision"
**Not Explained:**
- Specific COVID-19 transmission risks with breath devices
- Alternative safety measures considered (cleaning protocols, barriers, etc.)
- Scientific evidence supporting equipment unavailability
- Why blood/urine collection deemed safer than breath testing

### Decision-Making Authority
**Not Documented:**
- Who made the decision to deem equipment unavailable
- Whether decision was Jersey-local or Operation Talla-wide
- Consultation process before implementation
- Review mechanisms or sunset provisions

### Enforcement Impact
**Acknowledged:** Some offenders will evade detection
**Not Addressed:**
- Road safety impact assessment
- Alternative enforcement strategies
- Public notification of reduced enforcement capability
- Duration of equipment unavailability

## Connection to Broader Operation Talla

### Consistent with Ethical Approach UK Findings

**Supports Assessment:**
- ✅ Top-down decision-making
- ✅ Operational procedure modifications
- ✅ Reduced enforcement capabilities accepted
- ✅ Decisions characterized as "lawful and reasonable" without detailed justification
- ✅ Trade-offs acknowledged but not thoroughly assessed

**Ethical Approach UK Conclusion:**
> "Operation Talla was not merely a policing operation, but a structural reconfiguration of law enforcement under centralised, quasi-military coordination."

**Jersey Document Evidence:**
- Centralized equipment unavailability decision
- Standard procedure modifications
- Legal framework adaptations
- Accepted reduction in law enforcement effectiveness

### Pattern Recognition

**Similar to:**
- Custody procedure modifications (NPCC guidance)
- Fixed Penalty Notice processes (ACRO centralization)
- Enforcement priority shifts (public health over other crimes)
- Operational trade-offs accepted system-wide

## Procedural Detail Documentation

### Full Station Procedure Outline

**When Operation TALLA active:**
1. Arrest based on observable intoxication (no screening test)
2. Station detention authorized for excess alcohol investigation

- Blood only if drugs or drug/alcohol combination suspected

### Forms and Documentation

**Modified Forms:**
- CJU 24A (main custody form)
