# Source - GMC Response to Mark Sexton Complaint July 2024

## Overview
Official response letter from the General Medical Council to Mark Sexton regarding his complaint about TV doctors promoting COVID-19 vaccines while allegedly receiving pharmaceutical industry payments.

## Key Details
- **Date:** July 15, 2024
- **Reference:** E1-4418967221
- **From:** General Medical Council, The Enquiries Team (on behalf of Assistant Registrar)
- **To:** Mr Mark Sexton
- **Method:** Email only

## Complaint Summary
Mark Sexton complained about:
- **Named Doctors:** Dr Hilary Jones, Dr Ranjit Singh, Dr Sarah Jarvis
- **Allegations:**
  - Expressing public support for COVID-19 vaccines while receiving pharmaceutical industry payments
  - Conflict of interest - placing monetary gain ahead of patient safety
  - Administering vaccines knowing they are not safe
  - Making baseless, misleading, and potentially criminal claims that vaccines are "100% safe and effective"
  - Lying to and misleading the public

## GMC Decision
- **Outcome:** Declined to investigate
- **Reasoning:**
  - Information provided does not support that doctors deliberately lied or misled public
  - Doctors' opinions on vaccinations were not contrary to public health advice at the time
  - Opinions would be supported by reasonable body of medical practitioners
  - No information suggesting payments influenced treatment of their own patients
  - Issues do not call into question doctors' fitness to practise

## Referrals Made
GMC referred complainant to other bodies:
1. **Ofcom (Office of Communications)** - for complaints about TV broadcast claims
2. **MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency)** - for vaccine safety and promotion concerns
3. **Department of Health** - for general vaccine rollout and information provided by medical practitioners

## GMC Position on Broader Issues
- Can only consider specific concerns about individual doctors on medical register
- Cannot consider concerns about organizations or doctors as a whole
- Only able to investigate where issues raise serious concerns about fitness to practise
- Not a general complaints organization
- Part of wider medical regulation framework

## Review Mechanism
- GMC offered Rule 12 internal review process
- Will only review if:
  - Serious mistake with decision that could lead to different outcome, OR
  - Significant new information not previously seen
  - Review necessary to protect wider public
- Review must start within two years of original decision unless exceptional circumstances

## Mark Sexton's Response (July 16, 2024)
Requested Rule 12 review with grounds including:
1. **Public protection** - 250,000+ excess deaths and millions injured since vaccine rollout
2. **Legal protection for doctors** - not providing informed consent per Montgomery v Lanarkshire 2015
3. **Evidence ignored** - previous evidence not properly considered
4. **New evidence** - Dr Francis Boyle affidavit (bioweapons expert), The Hope Accord (41,221 co-signers)

### Key Arguments in Review Request
- **Informed Consent:** All doctors must disclose per Montgomery ruling:
  - Experimental nature of mRNA vaccines
  - Unknown long-term safety and efficacy
  - 1000+ possible side-effects listed by manufacturer
  - Manufacturer has full legal indemnity
  - Patients are part of 3-year medical trial
  - Alternative treatments were suppressed
  
- **GMC Responsibility:**
  - Duty to notify all 380,000 registered doctors
  - Failure to act may constitute Corporate Manslaughter
  - Failure to act may breach contract with paid members (Â£455 annual fee)
  
- **Double Standard:**
  - TV doctors (Jones, Singh, Jarvis) promoted vaccines, received pharma payments, not investigated
  - Independent doctors (Malhotra, Cartland, Adil, White) challenged narrative, refused pharma payments, were investigated
  
- **Supporting Evidence:**
  - Pfizer government contracts admitting unknown long-term effects and efficacy
  - Dr Francis Boyle affidavit stating mRNA injections are bioweapons/WMD
  - WHO liability notice served by doctors and lawyers
  - Pfizer found guilty of promoting unlicensed vaccines
  - Dr Malhotra testimony in Helsinki courts
  - Nuremberg codes and Declaration of Helsinki breached
  - Kansas Attorney General suing Pfizer for lying about safety
  - Lancet peer-reviewed paper: 325 autopsies, 74% deaths caused by vaccines
  - The Hope Accord: 1,283 medical doctors, 3,474 healthcare professionals, 1,369 scientists calling for vaccine suspension
