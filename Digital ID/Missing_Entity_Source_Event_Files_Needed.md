## Files That May Need Updating

### Existing Files to Review for Additional References
1. All remaining Entity files in the /Entities folder
2. All remaining Event files in the /Events folder
3. All remaining Finding files in the /Findings folder
4. All Collection files in the /Collections folder
5. The main Digital ID.md overview file
6. Research Agenda.md

## Summary Statistics

### References Fixed Per File Type:
- **Investigation Files**: ~45 references fixed across 3 files
- **Entity Files**: ~15 references fixed across key files (Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates)
- **Event Files**: ~20 references fixed (COVID Health Pass Rollout)
- **Finding Files**: ~8 references fixed (Five-Phase Evolution)
- **Source Files**: ~25 references fixed (Digital ID Systems Global Intelligence Update)

### Total New Files Needed: ~60 files
- Entity files: ~40
- Source files: ~15
- Finding files: ~6

### Patterns Noticed:
1. **Systematic Under-linking**: Almost every mention of countries, organizations, and people lacked proper double brackets
2. **Source Confusion**: Many sources were referenced inconsistently or without proper Source- prefixes
3. **Missing Hierarchies**: Need better organization between entities (countries, states, cities)
4. **Cross-Reference Gaps**: Many related concepts weren't linked despite clear connections

### Priority Creation Order:
1. **High Priority Entities**: Major countries ([[Entity - China]], [[Entity - India]], [[Entity - Vietnam]], [[Entity - Nigeria]], [[Entity - European Union]], [[Entity - United States]])
2. **High Priority Sources**: Key government documents and academic research
3. **Medium Priority**: International organizations and court decisions
4. **Lower Priority**: Media organizations and individual academic institutions

This comprehensive linking will significantly improve the vault's interconnectedness and research utility.
