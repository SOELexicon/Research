## Annex A
**Date:** 18 May 2025  
**From:** Maya Forstater (Sex Matters CEO)  
**To:** Secretary of State Peter Kyle

### Key Letter Content:
- Response to Peter Kyle's letter of 15 May 2025
- Welcomes government recognition that:
  1. Accurate data is essential
  2. Sex data should be accurate when processed by public authorities
  3. Data must be accurate for its purpose and not misleading
  4. Sex data on passports is not reliable to verify biological sex

### Three Key Problems Identified:
1. **Privacy Concerns:** Public authorities providing data won't know specific purpose - DVS providers will not know what sex data is being requested for
2. **Terminology Confusion:** Letter appears to distinguish between "sex" and "biological sex" - these terms mean the same thing per Supreme Court and Sullivan Review
3. **Existing Inaccuracy:** Promise that people can verify sex digitally with same accuracy as physical documents - but government acknowledges passports don't record accurate sex data

### Proposed Solution:
Step-by-step approach based on Ben Spencer MP's New Clause 21:
- Review datasets relating to sex attribute
- Identify and categorize datasets (sex/gender/mixed)
- Publish register of datasets
- Establish information gateway with approved sources
- Update trust framework to only accept reliable sources

Warns of data protection breaches and years of unnecessary confusion if not addressed properly.

## Annex B
**File:** The Sullivan Review and the Data Bill  
**Date:** 20 March 2025  
**Type:** Parliamentary briefing

### The Sullivan Review:
- Review by Professor Alice Sullivan of University College London
- Documents grave problems with official data on sex and gender
- NHS and police have stopped collecting sex data, replacing with self-declared gender identity
- Recommends sex data collected by default in all research commissioned by public bodies
- Secretary of State for Health committed to acting on findings

### The Data (Use and Access) Bill:
- Provides framework for digital verification services
- Opportunity to solve unreliable sex data problem
- Must exclude unreliable records (Passport Office, DVLA) from verification
- Should link to robust sources (digitised birth register, accurate health records)

### The Solution:
- DVS can solve privacy and accuracy issues if properly designed
- Must recognize need for accurate sex data in trust framework
- Recording sex accurately with consent is compatible with human rights
- Digital systems can treat attributes separately with privacy built in

---

## Annex C
**Date:** 15 May 2025  
**From:** Secretary of State Peter Kyle  
**To:** Maya Forstater

### Government Position:
- Part 2 of Data Bill introduces information gateway for digital identity checks
- Measures "do not change the evidence that individuals rely on to prove things about themselves"
- DVS cannot be used to circumvent existing routes for updating sex/gender on documents
- Government accepts Supreme Court judgment on sex definition for equality legislation
- Working through impacts "holistically and with care, sensitivity and kindness"
- Public authorities decide what data to share for their purposes
- Data sharing must comply with existing data protection legislation
- Government developing data standards for consistency between authorities

Asks Maya to share letter with supporters for reassurance about information gateway.

## Annex D
**Date:** 28 July 2025  
**From:** Secretary of State Peter Kyle  
**To:** Maya Forstater

### Response to Multiple Letters:

- Wants to ensure voice is heard in next steps

---

## Annex E
**File:** Briefing on Data (Use and Access) Bill - Personal data integrity is a human right  
**Date:** 26 February 2025

### Foreword by Lord Arbuthnot of Edrom:
- Warns of risk from digital identities framework reaching across government departments
- Compares to Post Office scandal potential
- Highlights public bodies not keeping accurate sex records
- Warns of tragic mix of personal suffering and public waste without safeguards

### Key Concerns:
- Material fact of biological sex needs reliable recording at birth
- Accurate data routinely needed in healthcare, sport, law enforcement, single-sex services
- Wrong sex recording can lead to:
  - Medical misdiagnosis and wrong treatment
  - Care agencies unable to match sex preferences
  - Transgender people receiving contradictory records causing system issues
  - "Synthetic data" fraud risks

### Baby Lilah Case Study:
- Born November 2024, accidentally recorded as "male" on birth certificate
- Illustrates fundamental duty of state to ensure accurate foundational information
- Error will flow into digital identity data creating lifetime of problems

### Three Safeguards Proposed:
1. Secretary of State must assess whether public authorities handle personal data accurately (clause 28(4))
2. Public authorities can only share accurate data, must know what it refers to (clause 45(6))
3. Secretary of State may establish "data dictionary" to prevent confusion (clause 140)

---

## Annex F
**Date:** 11 April 2025  
**From:** Maya Forstater (Sex Matters)  
**To:** Secretary of State Peter Kyle

### Follow-up from 9 April Meeting:
- Thanks for productive meeting with Lord Arbuthnot
- Clarifies intention of amendments: ensure reliable data can be trusted
- Distinguishes between "What is this person's sex?" vs "What is their gender identity?"
- Birth certificate/GRC for sex vs census data for gender identity

### Purpose and Data Protection:
- Sullivan Review shows authorities mixing sex and gender identity data
- Legal advice indicates likely GDPR breaches regarding accuracy
- Cannot provide "F" or "M" without knowing if it means sex or gender

### Five Examples of Where Sex Matters:
1. **Education:** Required for school registration and single-sex schools
2. **Healthcare:** Section 251B establishes duty to share personal information
3. **Employment:** Equality Act allows occupational requirements for sex
4. **Sports:** Section 195 allows sex-segregated sports based on biological sex
5. **Dating/Consent:** Digital identity services process sex data for matching

### Concerns About Unlawful Exclusion:
- Not trying to "out" transgender people
- Concern is unreliable sources (HMPO, DVLA, NHS) being treated as reliable
- DVS shares attributes only with consent
- System should identify trustworthy sources, not create national sex database

---

## Annex G
**Date:** 24 June 2025  
**From:** Maya Forstater  
**To:** Secretary of State Peter Kyle

### Post-Royal Assent Communication:
- Following Data (Use and Access) Act receiving Royal Assent on 19 June
- Requests meeting with Hannah Rutter and relevant officials
- Ministers gave assurances DVS will verify accurate sex data
- Won't use unreliable sources like passport data for biological sex

### Warning of Consequences:
- If not properly set up, DVS will fail to secure trust
- Will fail to achieve efficiencies and economic growth
- Will fail to comply with the law
- Problem is solvable now with practical steps

### Three-Step Practical Solution:
1. Include requirement in code of practice for authorities to review sex datasets
2. Publish register of approved authorities as reliable sex data sources
3. Provide trust framework directions treating only registered sources as authoritative

References Minister Bryant's Pride Month comments suggesting confusion remains about privacy concerns.

## Annex H
**File:** Sex and digital identities briefing  
**Date:** June 2025

### Context:
- Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 received Royal Assent 19 June
- Creates framework for digital identity services
- Parliament raised concerns about unreliable data sources

### Minister Assurances (Lord Vallance, 12 May 2025):
- Government clear data must be accurate for purpose
- DVS providers must know what information means
- Cannot check biological sex against passport data
- DVS could only verify using data recording sex specifically

### Implementation Requirements:
Three elements must work together:
- **Code of practice** for public authorities
- **Trust framework** for certifying providers
- **Information gateway** linking data sources

### Proposed Actions:
1. Review and categorize sex/gender datasets
2. Establish register of approved sources
3. Update trust framework to only accept registered sources

### Risks if Not Addressed:
- Launch "trusted digital identity" without safeguards
- Create synthetic identity risks from mismatched records
- Unable to provide accurate information for safety/single-sex services
- Legal challenges and financial costs

### Initial Contact (First Letter):
- Introduction as CEO of Sex Matters
- Welcomes Data Use and Access Bill introduction
- Highlights opportunity to resolve sex data confusion
- Notes NHS and government documents don't record sex accurately
- People can change passport/license data with simple request

### Key Concerns:
- Digital identity framework relies on unreliable authoritative sources
- Medical misdiagnosis and wrong dosages possible
- Research integrity undermined
- DBS checks unreliable
- Care agencies and rape crisis centers can't answer sex questions straightforwardly
- Dating sites can't exclude opposite sex
- Service providers can't communicate/enforce sex-based rules

### Sullivan Review Reference:
- Review of Data, Statistics and Research on Sex and Gender
- Led by Professor Alice Sullivan
- Documents falsifying official records destroys system integrity
- If any "M" or "F" might relate to opposite sex, no verification possible

### Proposed Solutions:
- Data standard must clarify "sex" means actual/biological sex
- Disallow unreliable sources (licenses, passports, NHS records, birth certificates)
- Reliable sources: original birth records, unambiguous medical records, cheek-swab tests
- New electronic birth/death register provides reliable foundation
- Digital identity enables privacy-protecting functionality (QR codes for age/clearance without revealing sex)

Requests early engagement in legislative process.

## Document Observation
The correspondence shows an extensive, sustained engagement between Sex Matters and DSIT over approximately 10 months (October 2024 - July 2025), with particular intensity around the Data (Use and Access) Bill debates in Parliament during May 2025. The organization pursued multiple channels including direct ministerial correspondence, meetings, urgent pre-debate communications, and engagement via Lord Arbuthnot. The central issue throughout is ensuring that digital verification services can accurately verify biological sex where needed, while not compromising privacy or forcing unnecessary disclosure.
