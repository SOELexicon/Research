# J&J COVID vaccine lawsuits face near-total immunity shield

Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine has generated virtually no successful litigation despite confirmed deaths and serious injuries. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act provides near-absolute immunity from lawsuits, resulting in zero settlements with injury victims, zero successful verdicts, and consistent dismissals of all cases. This stands in stark contrast to J&J's 58,000+ pending talc lawsuits. While federal regulators confirmed causal links between the Janssen vaccine and rare but serious conditions—including 9 deaths from blood clots and 100+ cases of paralysis—injured individuals face a compensation system with a 98% denial rate averaging under $4,000 per approved claim.

The legal landscape represents an extraordinary departure from traditional product liability: manufacturers cannot be sued except for "willful misconduct" requiring proof of intentional wrongdoing, a bar no plaintiff has successfully cleared. Meanwhile, the only available remedy—the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP)—has compensated just 13 COVID vaccine injury claims total out of 13,764 filed. The vaccine was voluntarily withdrawn from the U.S. market in May 2023, and PREP Act immunity has been extended through December 31, 2029.

## Minimal litigation despite regulatory safety concerns

Traditional product liability lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson for their COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen) are extremely rare, with only 10-15 identifiable cases in public court records. No multidistrict litigation (MDL) has been established, no class actions certified, and no law firm mass tort campaigns launched—a striking absence compared to virtually every other major pharmaceutical controversy.

The most detailed case is **Zimmerman v. King County** (Case No. 24-2-04429-9 KNT), filed in 2024 in Washington State and Pennsylvania. Michelle Zimmerman alleged she developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after receiving vaccine lot 1805031, which the lawsuit claimed had approximately 29,000 doses administered resulting in 1,437 severe adverse reactions and 67 deaths—an alleged incidence rate of 1 severe reaction per 20 injections. The lawsuit attempted to overcome PREP Act immunity by alleging manufacturing contamination at Emergent BioSolutions' Baltimore facility, where up to 400 million doses were reportedly cross-contaminated with AstraZeneca vaccine, and by arguing defendants failed to comply with FDA emergency authorization requirements. The case was dismissed and is now on appeal.

Additional federal cases were filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey starting in 2021, including cases by plaintiffs named Zenez, D'Antona, Scheibe, Courtois, Crook, Johnson, Heath, Vaughters, Francone, and Mitchell (as recently as May 2025). However, case outcomes are not publicly available, and most were likely dismissed early based on PREP Act immunity.

No MDL consolidation exists because the volume of cases is insufficient and PREP Act immunity prevents most lawsuits from being filed in the first place. This is particularly notable given that approximately 18.7 million doses of J&J vaccine were administered in the United States before the product was withdrawn.

## Serious injuries alleged with regulatory confirmation

The primary medical conditions alleged in lawsuits are thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)—both confirmed by the FDA to have causal relationships with the Janssen vaccine.

**Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS)** is a rare but life-threatening condition involving blood clots in unusual locations combined with dangerously low platelet counts. The most serious manifestation is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), where blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses, blocking drainage and causing increased intracranial pressure, brain swelling, hemorrhagic stroke, and potentially death. Other locations include splenic, hepatic, portal, and visceral veins, as well as pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

The FDA stated in December 2021: "Currently available evidence supports a causal relationship between TTS and the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine." As of August 2021, 54 confirmed TTS cases occurred out of approximately 14-18 million doses, with the highest risk in women ages 30-49 (approximately 10.6 cases per million doses in women 30-39). The condition typically appeared 6-15 days after vaccination, with a median onset of 8 days. The mechanism involves antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4), similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but without heparin exposure. A genetic variant (IGLV3-21*02) has been identified as a causative factor.

**Clinical outcomes were severe**: All 15 initial TTS patients required hospitalization, with 12 admitted to intensive care units. The fatality rate was approximately 15%—9 confirmed deaths occurred, with ages ranging from 28 to 62 years (median 45). One documented case involved a 48-year-old woman who developed extensive splanchnic-vein thrombosis, then CVST leading to hemorrhagic stroke despite heparin treatment (notably, heparin can worsen TTS, and treatment requires non-heparin anticoagulants and intravenous immunoglobulin).

**Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)** is an acute autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks peripheral nerves, causing progressive, ascending paralysis. The FDA added a warning in July 2021 after approximately 100 cases were reported out of 12.8 million doses, with 95 requiring hospitalization and 1 death. The incidence rate within 1-21 days after vaccination was 32.4 per 100,000 person-years—significantly higher than the background rate of 1-2 per 100,000. Most cases occurred in men aged 50 and older, typically within 42 days of vaccination.

Steve Wenger's case illustrates the severity: He developed paralysis from the waist down 7 days after his May 2021 vaccination. His Mayo Clinic physician documented chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) "triggered by COVID vaccination" in clinical notes. Wenger spent 98 days hospitalized, lost the ability to pick up a glass of water due to arm weakness, and four years later still has nerve damage in both legs and facial muscles despite recovering the ability to walk after 9 months.

Plaintiffs establish causation through temporal proximity (symptoms appearing within established risk windows), medical documentation explicitly linking conditions to vaccination, laboratory evidence (positive anti-PF4 antibodies for TTS, electrodiagnostic testing for GBS), and FDA acknowledgment of causal relationships. Legal arguments focus on failure to warn, inadequate safety testing, manufacturing defects at the Emergent facility, and violations of informed consent requirements.

## Zero settlements, consistent dismissals define outcomes

No settlements between Johnson & Johnson and vaccine injury claimants have been reported. The only settlement involving the J&J COVID vaccine was a $50 million commercial dispute between Emergent BioSolutions and J&J in July 2024, resolving a breach-of-contract claim after J&J terminated their manufacturing agreement following the contamination scandal. This was a business-to-business settlement with no compensation for injured individuals.

Courts have uniformly dismissed COVID vaccine lawsuits based on PREP Act immunity. The Zimmerman case—the most detailed J&J vaccine injury lawsuit—was dismissed after the court granted a motion to dismiss, ruling that PREP Act immunity applied even with allegations of manufacturing contamination and FDA compliance failures. The case is now on appeal in Washington State Court of Appeals (Division One, No. 876295), representing the first appellate-level challenge to PREP Act immunity in the J&J vaccine context.

In related precedent-setting cases involving other manufacturers, courts have consistently upheld broad PREP Act immunity. In September 2024, an Alabama federal court dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit against Pfizer. In December 2024, a U.S. District Court for Northern District of Texas dismissed Texas v. Pfizer, a state consumer protection lawsuit, finding PREP Act preempts state law claims (Texas appealed in January 2025). Kansas filed a similar consumer protection lawsuit against Pfizer that was removed to federal court, where PREP Act immunity is being asserted.

The sole avenue for compensation is the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), an administrative program with devastating statistics. As of April 2025, of 13,764 total COVID countermeasure claims filed, 4,111 have been decided. Of those decided, only 67 were found eligible (1.6% of decided claims), and only 13 COVID vaccine injury claims have actually been compensated. This represents a 98.4% denial rate, with 4,044 claims denied outright. Total compensation paid for all 13 approved COVID vaccine claims combined is less than $50,000, averaging under $4,000 per person—most for myocarditis, pericarditis, or anaphylaxis rather than the more severe TTS or GBS cases.

CICP's limitations explain the low compensation rate: claimants must file within 1 year of vaccination (many miss this strict deadline), prove causation with "compelling, reliable, valid, medical, and scientific evidence," and wait an average of 14+ months for decisions. Unlike the traditional Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), CICP provides no attorney fees, no pain and suffering compensation, no punitive damages, and no judicial review. Maximum compensation is capped at $50,000/year for lost wages and a $370,376 death benefit, covering only unreimbursed medical expenses.

No multidistrict litigation has been established, no class actions certified, and no trials have occurred. The pattern is absolute: PREP Act immunity prevents litigation from proceeding past the motion to dismiss stage, and plaintiffs cannot conduct discovery into manufacturing practices, safety studies, or internal communications.

## Vaccine liability framework creates unprecedented immunity

Product liability for COVID-19 vaccines operates under an entirely different legal structure than traditional pharmaceutical litigation. The PREP Act, invoked by HHS Secretary Alex Azar on March 17, 2020 (effective February 4, 2020), provides sweeping immunity from suit and liability under federal and state law for manufacturers, distributors, and administrators of COVID-19 vaccines. The protection was originally set to expire December 31, 2024, but was extended through December 31, 2029 via the Twelfth Amendment in December 2024.

According to 42 U.S.C. § 247d-6d, "a covered person shall be immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law with respect to all claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the administration or use of a covered countermeasure." This immunity is geographic and jurisdictional—covering all activities related to "manufacture, testing, development, distribution, administration, and use" of vaccines without limitation.

The sole exception is "willful misconduct" causing death or serious physical injury. However, the legal standard is exceptionally high, requiring plaintiffs to prove by "clear and convincing evidence" (higher than typical civil cases) that the defendant acted: (i) intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose; (ii) knowingly without legal or factual justification; and (iii) in disregard of a known risk so great as to make it highly probable that harm will outweigh benefit. Additional barriers include: claims can only be filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia; plaintiffs must first exhaust CICP remedies; defendants cannot be held liable if they complied with federal regulations; and plaintiffs must plead with particularity, verify under oath, and provide an affidavit from a non-treating physician. To date, no willful misconduct claim against any COVID vaccine manufacturer has succeeded.

Courts have consistently ruled that PREP Act preempts state tort claims, state consumer protection statutes, common law fraud claims, and wrongful death claims. Even allegations of severe manufacturing problems—including cross-contamination of 400 million doses, FDA warnings about facility non-compliance, and high adverse event rates in specific lots—have been deemed insufficient to overcome immunity. Courts distinguish between "willful misconduct" (intentional wrongdoing, not immune) and negligence or even gross negligence (still immune).

The exclusive remedy is CICP, administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). CICP remedies "shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding" except for willful misconduct claims. This no-fault administrative system has a 1-year statute of limitations, no judicial review, and limited compensation excluding pain and suffering, attorney fees, and punitive damages.

COVID-19 vaccines fall under CICP rather than the more generous Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) because they were developed under Emergency Use Authorization. VICP, which covers routine childhood vaccines, offers significantly better terms: a 3-year filing deadline, adjudication by U.S. Court of Federal Claims, compensation for pain and suffering, coverage of attorney fees, average awards of $500,000, and a 70% success rate. Since 1988, VICP has paid $5.3+ billion in compensation. Moving COVID vaccines to VICP would require Congressional action imposing an excise tax and HHS Secretary adding the vaccine to the Vaccine Injury Table—neither has occurred despite calls from advocates.

## Approximately 18 million doses administered before withdrawal

The number of lawsuits is strikingly minimal given the scale of vaccine administration. Approximately 18.7 million doses of J&J's single-shot vaccine were administered in the United States from February 2021 through May 2023, when the last doses expired. Only 10-15 individual lawsuits have been identified in public court records—a litigation rate of less than 1 case per million doses administered.

Geographically, identified cases include: Washington State (Zimmerman case in King County), Pennsylvania (Zimmerman case in Montgomery County), and New Jersey (multiple federal cases in U.S. District Court for District of New Jersey). Additional cases may have been filed in other jurisdictions but are not publicly accessible without PACER subscriptions or may have been dismissed so early that limited public records exist.

CICP does not track claims by specific vaccine manufacturer, making it impossible to determine how many of the 13,764 total COVID countermeasure claims filed involve the J&J vaccine specifically. Given J&J's smaller market share compared to Pfizer and Moderna (which together administered hundreds of millions of doses), J&J-specific claims likely represent a smaller proportion of total CICP filings.

The stark contrast with other J&J litigation is instructive. J&J faces 58,000+ pending lawsuits for talc/baby powder in MDL consolidation, with multiple jury verdicts (including $72 million, $417 million, and $4.7 billion awards, some later reduced) and a proposed $9 billion settlement. The company settled 25,000 Xarelto cases for $775 million and faces 795 cases in MDL for Elmiron. For the COVID vaccine, by comparison: zero verdicts, zero settlements with injury victims, no MDL, and minimal court activity. The difference is solely attributable to PREP Act immunity.

## J&J emphasized safety monitoring while relying on federal immunity

Johnson & Johnson's response to potential vaccine injury litigation centered on regulatory compliance and transparency rather than active legal defense, as PREP Act immunity prevented most lawsuits from being filed. The company never faced significant courtroom battles over vaccine injuries, instead focusing on public communications about safety and cooperation with regulators.

When Guillain-Barré Syndrome concerns emerged in July 2021, J&J issued a statement: "The safety and well-being of the people who use our products is our number one priority. Rare cases of the neurological disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported following vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Most occurred within 42 days after vaccination. While the chance of having this occur is very low, Johnson & Johnson has updated its COVID-19 Vaccine Factsheet to include important information about these rare cases and on the signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome."

For TTS blood clot issues, the company acknowledged through FDA Fact Sheet updates that "Blood clots involving blood vessels in the brain, lungs, abdomen, and legs along with low levels of platelets have occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine," noting that "symptoms began approximately one to two-weeks following vaccination" and "reporting of these blood clots and low levels of platelets has been highest in females ages 18 through 49 years."

Throughout, J&J maintained that benefits outweighed risks, stating: "Evidence has demonstrated that Johnson & Johnson's single-shot COVID-19 vaccine offers protection against COVID-19 disease and prevents hospitalization and death. A single-shot vaccine that provides this level of protection represents an important tool in the global fight against COVID-19." The company emphasized its not-for-profit commitment, pledging over $1 billion toward vaccine development with public statements that "we're going to do this not for profit."

The company complied with evolving regulatory requirements. After the April 2021 pause, J&J updated warnings and fact sheets. When the CDC recommended mRNA vaccines over J&J in December 2021, the company responded that "Data continue to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in adults, when compared with no vaccine." After the FDA severely restricted use in May 2022 to adults who cannot receive other vaccines or specifically request J&J, the company continued to emphasize regulatory compliance.

On May 22, 2023, Janssen voluntarily requested withdrawal of its Emergency Use Authorization. The FDA revoked the EUA on June 1, 2023, after the last U.S. government stock expired on May 7, 2023. J&J characterized this as a business decision based on expiration of government stock, lack of market demand, and the decision not to update the vaccine for emerging variants.

The company's legal protection was structural rather than adversarial. As one legal analysis noted: "When the government said, 'We want you to develop this four or five times faster than you normally do,' most likely the manufacturers said to the government, 'We want you, the government, to protect us from multimillion-dollar lawsuits.'" J&J benefited from the federal government's policy decision to provide liability protection, and the company's primary defense argument was regulatory compliance—critical because willful misconduct claims "cannot recover at all if the pharmaceutical company can show that it complied with federal regulations."

## Manufacturing contamination allegations failed to overcome immunity

Despite serious quality control issues at the manufacturing facility, no court has found these problems sufficient to defeat PREP Act immunity. The most significant manufacturing controversy involved Emergent BioSolutions' Baltimore Bayview facility, which J&J contracted with in April 2020 for $135 million to produce vaccine doses.

In March 2021, Emergent admitted cross-contamination with AstraZeneca vaccine at the facility. A May 2022 House Committee on Oversight and Reform report revealed that nearly 400 million doses were potentially compromised. J&J destroyed 15 million confirmed contaminated doses and later terminated its 5-year contract with Emergent in 2022. The two companies settled their resulting breach-of-contract dispute for $50 million in July 2024.

The Zimmerman lawsuit specifically cited vaccine lot 1805031, which plaintiffs alleged had an extraordinary adverse event rate: approximately 29,000 doses administered with 1,437 severe adverse reactions and 67 deaths—an alleged incidence rate of 1 severe reaction per 20 injections and 1 death per 433 injections. The lawsuit argued these manufacturing quality control failures, combined with alleged non-compliance with FDA emergency authorization requirements, should remove PREP Act protection. The court rejected this argument and dismissed the case.

Additional quality issues emerged in 2024-2025. In November 2024, FDA inspection of a Janssen Vaccines facility in South Korea revealed quality control problems. On July 18, 2025, the FDA issued a warning letter to Janssen Vaccines for manufacturing violations. Despite this pattern of regulatory concerns about manufacturing practices, courts have ruled that such issues constitute negligence—or at most gross negligence—which remains protected under PREP Act immunity.

## No precedent-setting rulings specific to J&J vaccine

Due to early dismissals based on immunity, no significant legal precedents have emerged specific to J&J COVID vaccine litigation. The absence of discovery, trials, and substantive rulings means the litigation has not produced the kind of precedent-setting decisions typical in major pharmaceutical cases.

However, cross-applicable precedents from COVID vaccine litigation involving other manufacturers establish the legal framework. Courts have consistently held that PREP Act provides comprehensive immunity that preempts state tort claims, state consumer protection statutes, common law fraud claims, and wrongful death claims. The sole exception—willful misconduct—has not been successfully proven in any case.

The Zimmerman dismissal established that even severe manufacturing problems, FDA warnings about facility non-compliance, and high adverse event rates in specific lots are insufficient to overcome PREP Act immunity. Courts distinguish between "willful misconduct" (intentional wrongdoing, not immune) and negligence or gross negligence (still immune). Manufacturing quality issues don't defeat immunity because they don't constitute the intentional wrongdoing required for willful misconduct.

Courts have also ruled that violations of FDA Emergency Use Authorization requirements, violations of CDC guidelines, and failure to comply with HHS Secretary declarations do not create a private right of action or remove PREP Act immunity. The Zimmerman case attempted to argue that non-compliance with EUA requirements removes immunity, but the court rejected this theory.

In a related context, courts have addressed whether PREP Act "completely preempts" state law claims. The Third, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits have held that PREP Act does not provide complete preemption in nursing home COVID-19 death cases, allowing some claims to proceed in state court. However, these rulings don't affect vaccine manufacturer immunity—they apply to nursing home liability where different considerations apply. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in 2022, leaving the circuit split unresolved.

One narrow exception emerged in North Carolina in 2024-2025, where the state supreme court ruled PREP Act does not preempt state parental consent laws, allowing claims for vaccination without parental consent to proceed. However, the court emphasized that PREP Act still preempts injury and tort claims—the ruling only affects consent, not injury compensation.

Federal courts have uniformly rejected attempts by state attorneys general to use consumer protection laws as an end-run around PREP Act immunity. Texas and Kansas filed lawsuits alleging vaccine manufacturers made misleading efficacy claims, framing them as consumer protection violations rather than product liability claims. In December 2024, a federal judge dismissed the Texas case, ruling PREP Act provided immunity. Kansas's similar lawsuit was removed to federal court where immunity defenses are pending. These cases represent creative attempts to circumvent PREP Act, but courts have not allowed such workarounds.

## Conclusion: immunity without accountability

The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine litigation landscape reveals a legal framework that effectively eliminates manufacturer accountability despite federal regulatory agencies confirming causal links between the vaccine and serious injuries, including 9 deaths from blood clots. The PREP Act's near-absolute immunity has produced zero settlements with injury victims, zero successful verdicts, and consistent dismissal of all cases. Meanwhile, the exclusive compensation mechanism—CICP—has a 98% denial rate and has paid an average of under $4,000 per approved claim.

This stands in stark contrast not only to other pharmaceutical litigation but to the traditional vaccine injury system. Where VICP compensates 70% of claims with average awards of $500,000 and has paid $5.3 billion since 1988, CICP has approved just 13 COVID vaccine injury claims for under $50,000 total. The legal doctrine distinguishes COVID vaccines as emergency countermeasures meriting special protection, effectively creating a two-tier system where emergency authorization eliminates the due process and meaningful compensation available for routine vaccines.

The manufacturing contamination at Emergent BioSolutions—potentially affecting 400 million doses—illustrates the immunity's breadth. Even systematic quality control failures, FDA warnings, and extraordinarily high adverse event rates in specific vaccine lots proved insufficient to overcome PREP Act protection. Courts ruled such issues constitute negligence, which remains immune, rather than the intentional wrongdoing required for willful misconduct.

With PREP Act immunity extended through December 31, 2029, this legal landscape will persist for years. Injured individuals have no realistic path to compensation beyond the failing CICP system. The sole possibility for change would be Congressional action moving COVID vaccines to VICP or a successful constitutional challenge—both considered unlikely. By 2030, when immunity might expire, statutes of limitations will likely bar most claims. The framework thus represents a policy choice prioritizing rapid vaccine development and deployment over traditional manufacturer accountability and injury victim compensation.
