## Letter Content

### Dear Mr Sexton

Thank you for sending us your complaint about Dr Hilary Jones, Dr Ranjit Singh and Dr Sarah Jarvis and for providing some additional information.

We have carefully considered all of the information you provided. However, we have not been able to identify any issues which would call into question the doctors' fitness to practise medicine, to the extent that we might need to take action on their registration.

### Our Role

We work with doctors, patients and other stakeholders to support good, safe patient care across the UK. We set the standards doctors and those who train them need to meet and help them achieve them. If there are concerns these standards may not be met or that public confidence in doctors may be at risk, we can investigate and take action if needed.

The purpose of an investigation is to determine if or to what extent we need to restrict the doctor from working. We are not a general complaints body and we have no legal powers to intervene in or resolve matters for patients.

### Our Decision

You have raised concerns about doctors and NHS organisations expressing public support or advertising the covid vaccine whilst receiving payments from the pharmaceutical industry. You consider this represents a conflict of interest, as they are placing monetary gain ahead of patients safety and wellbeing. You say doctors are administering vaccines knowing they are not safe and taking money whilst doing this and you say the public have been lied to and misled.

You consider the GMC has a moral, ethical, professional and lawful duty to notify all of its members to stop administering covid vaccines with immediate effect. The GMC is not a general complaints organisation but we form part of a wider framework of medical regulation. This involves local complaints procedures as well as other organisations involved in patient care. We are only able to consider concerns where the issues would raise a serious concern about the doctor's fitness to practise and where there is sufficient information that supports the concerns being raised.

You have concerns about the conduct of TV celebrity doctors who you say are paid by pharmaceutical companies and are making baseless, misleading and potentially criminal claims that the vaccines are 100% safe and effective and promoting dangerous products and you reference Dr Jones, Dr Singh and Dr Jarvis.

The information we have does not appear to support that Dr Jones, Dr Singh and Dr Jarvis have deliberately lied to or misled the public and the doctors opinions on vaccinations were not at the time contrary to public health advice or would be unsupported by any reasonable body of medical practitioners. We also note there is no information to support that any payment the doctors have received have influenced the way in which they would treat their own patients.

If you remain unhappy with the claims the doctors have made on TV, you may wish to raise this with the Office of Communications (Ofcom), the communications regulator, whose contact details are as follows:

#### Office of Communications (Ofcom)

- Tel: 0300 123 3333
- Website: https://www.ofcom.org.uk/complaints/get-in-touch

You have also raised a series of concerns about covid vaccinations and their safety and efficacy. You also make reference to a recent investigation of Pfizer and their promotion of unlicensed vaccines and you have provided us with supporting information. Within Fitness to Practise, we are only able to consider specific concerns about individual doctors who appear on the medical register. We cannot consider concerns about other organisations or doctors as a whole.

Concerns about the general rollout of the vaccine and information provided to patients by medical practitioners is something best addressed by the Department of Health. This is because the Government are responsible for the UK vaccination rollout.

If you are concerned about individuals or organisations who are promoting vaccinations, this is something best considered by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

If any serious concerns are identified about any individual doctor, these can be referred to us at that time.

### Our Independent Support Service

We recognise that raising concerns about a doctor can be a stressful experience. If you feel that you would like any support, you might wish to speak to our Independent support service (ISS). They are a free, confidential and independent telephone support service provided by Victim Support. You can contact them by calling 0300 303 3709 and find more information on their service here: www.victimsupport.org.uk/gmcnmc. Please be aware that the ISS are unable to discuss or advise on decisions made by the GMC.

### Reviewing Our Decision

We have an internal review mechanism ('Rule 12') which lets us look at certain decisions again. Attached is an FAQ document which explains more about the process.

We will only ever review a case if there is a serious mistake with the decision which, if corrected, could lead to a different outcome. Or if there is significant new information that we haven't seen before, which might have led to a different decision. We would then only review if at least one of those grounds was met and a review is necessary to protect the wider public. Any review needs to start within two years of the original decision, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

To request a review, please complete the attached questionnaire and return either via post or email, using the address provided on the form. Please note that we can only review concerns about doctors on our register.

We are sorry that we are unable to assist you further at this time.

Yours sincerely
