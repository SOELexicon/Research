## Post: Criminal Complaint Update - December 2021 (CRN 6029679/21)
December 2021 (late - "merry Christmas and 2022 will be ours for sure")
Update regarding the criminal complaint. 
Hannah Rose
1, a Detective Sergeant and Police Constable have been allocated to assess the complaint. We will need to provide them with a huge amount of evidence and we have made it clear we are all available to attend The Metropolitan Police at short notice in order to do. 
2, the Superintendent, assistant to Commissioner Cressida Dick is aware of the complaint and acknowledged as such to me by email this morning. 
He is leaving his current post but has forwarded the details onto his successor. 
3, The Metropolitan Police and the allocated officers have been provided details of the ICC application. 
The Met Police have a duty to carry out a full and competent criminal investigation as detailed in the ICC's guidelines. 
4, likewise lawyer Hannah Rose has provided the details of the criminal Investigation by The Met, including the notifications sent to all Chief Constables to the ICC investigation department. This was also sent with an urgent request to serve an injunction on the U.K. Government to stop all V's immediately. 
5, all 43 Chief Constables in England and Wales have been contacted by email to advise them of The Metropolitan Police's criminal investigation and the ICC application. (Late addition, Scotland and Northern Ireland Chiefs emailed also absolutely not forgetting you amazing people). 
They too have all been requested to stop the V program and make a public announcement in their local force areas. 
6, Lawyer Lois Bayliss (see previous post) has received a large number of emails from those damaged by the V. She is working tirelessly to get as many statements as possible and has now enlisted help from a number of lawyers and retired police so please bear with her. 
7, there are a large number of people working flat out behind the scenes to assist in stopping the V program. 
We are pushing the police and the ICC at every opportunity demanding the V's are stopped and to treat this as the national emergency that it is. 
When we get any further details we will provide an update. The crime number will be made public as soon as possible once we get the go ahead from the head of the investigating team. (Still to be determined). 
Be reassured, as a collective we will not stop and ask everyone to continue emailing, calling, sharing, serving notices and liability orders, yellow boards, leaflet drops, SITP, outreach, petitions and protests. 
Thank you, to all of you for your hard work and for fighting for my children's future and our country. 
God bless, merry Christmas and 2022 will be ours for sure.

Themes: original criminal complaint (6029679/21), Detective Sergeant and PC allocated, Commissioner Cressida Dick's assistant aware, ICC application filed, Hannah Rose lawyer, all 43 Chief Constables contacted, Lois Bayliss lawyer, vaccine-injured statements, grassroots mobilization, national emergency declaration demand

Video presenting evidence to Constable Thomas, also a shorter video of him issuing the crime number for the documented offences and naming the alleged offenders. 
Metropolitan Police, now carry out your lawful duty and protect the public from harm, injury and death. This nightmare has to stop and it's time to start arresting the criminals, all of them.  
The V has to be withdrawn immediately. 
Ladies and Gents, please accept this for what it is, be respectful and understand how hard I've worked to get this done AGAIN. 
We all know about the system, but we are 27 months further down the line since the first crime report. They can't whitewash this one because too many people know what's going on and the excess deaths cannot be hidden or ignored any longer. 
üôèüèªüôèüèª

## Post: COVID Vaccine Injured - Fraud and Assault Claims (March 2024)
To all of the COVID vaccine injured. Please watch this video. Fraud is identified and as a result you were tricked and lied to in order to take an unsafe vaccine. Had you been given informed consent, as it states in law, it is likely you would not have taken it. You suffered an unnecessary and avoidable injury as a direct result of the Fraud and the other already identified criminal acts. There were proven safe and effective treatments that worked, they were deliberately withheld by government policy and further evidence of the crimes committed against you. 
Please also see my previous video about the law and informed consent dated 14/3/24. 
I believe without the Fraud being committed you would not have been injured. Those injuries are an assault against your person and criminal under The offences against the person act 1861. 
For this very reason watch the video and I suggest you make contact with The Metropolitan Police stating you want to make a criminal complaint of assault and to add your details to crime number 01/62447/24. 
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/section/2

Comment from Darren Neal: "There is a subliminal message in AstraZeneca. Use Google translate and set it to translate Latin to English. Put in AstraZeneca in the following sequence using spaces as seen‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ a stra ze neca"

Themes: vaccine injured advocacy, fraud, informed consent, assault charges, Offences Against the Person Act 1861, crime number 01/62447/24, victim mobilization

## Post: Judicial Review Update (March 25, 2024)
Monday the 25th of March 2024. 
News regarding the Judicial Review. 
An application for a Judicial Review with supporting statements was made to the High Court on 9th of June 2023 to apply to judicially review the Metropolitan Police's closure of the Crime Reference number 6029679/21 from December 2021 and closed in February 2022. 
This application was dismissed on the 17th of November 2023 by a High Court Judge. An appeal against this decision was filed at the Court of Appeal within a week.
The Court of Appeal dismissed our application and appeal on the 19th of March 2024.
Exhausting all domestic procedures is a requirement for any application to the ICC (International Criminal Court)
We will inform you if there are any other developments.
Thank you 
Mark Sexton, for and on behalf of the legal team.

## Post: Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry (May 13, 2024)
If anyone out there still has any doubts about the mass murder of our beautiful elderly at the hands of doctors, nurses and carers all driven by government policy then look no further. 
15 minutes of heartbreaking testimony evidenced at the Scottish Covid Inquiry. Thank you to Murray Ofthefamily Phillips for sending me this. 
I'm not ashamed to say my eyes filled up more than once watching this. 
Accountability MUST happen one way or another. God bless to all of the deceased and to their heartbroken loved ones who had to endure this nightmare. üíîüíîüôèüèª

## Notes for Analysis
- Recurrent frames: mass non‚Äëcompliance; common law removal of government; allegations of state crimes in COVID response; calls to action; censorship claims.
- Evidence linkage: CPS submission corroborates the existence of an escalated complaint channel (see linked PDF). Assertions about inquiries/inquests require independent verification.
