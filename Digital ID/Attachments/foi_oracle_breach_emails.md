**Subject:** Oracle Breach - News Article

Lesley/Geoff/Brian,

We have been made aware of a story appearing in various online news outlets reporting a breach of Oracle Cloud infrastructure:

https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/the-biggest-supply-chain-hack-of-2025-6m-records-for-sale-exfiltrated-from-oracle-cloud-affecting-over-140k-tenants

https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-denies-data-breach-after-hacker-claims-theft-of-6-million-data-records/amp/

At the current time we can not confirm the legitimacy of these claims but nor can we ignore them.

We're undertaking checks and following up with colleagues at the NCSC and GC3 to see if they have any further information on this.

There's no action needed from yourselves at the moment and I'll endeavour to keep you up to date on this issue as and when we have more information.

## Emails from SG to Oracle, 24-26 March

**Sent:** Monday, March 24, 2025 10:41 AM  
**To:** [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]@oracle.com  
**Cc:** [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]@oracle.com; [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]@gov.scot; [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]@gov.scot  
**Subject:** [External] : Oracle Cloud Data Breach

Hi [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]

I am wondering if you can help. Cyber Security colleagues have flagged to our DG (Lesley Fraser) about articles about a possible data breach for Oracle Cloud where a threat actor is claiming they've stolen and are selling six million data records taken from Oracle's SSO login servers. I understand Oracle is denying that any data has been stolen, but obviously colleagues are concerned and are speaking to national cyber colleagues for further assurance. I think being part of the Gov Cloud gives any additional protections to us, but grateful for any information.

Happy to grab a chat if helpful, I know our next catch-up is next week so didn't want to leave this until then.

**Subject:** FW: [External] : Alleged Oracle Data Breach

HI [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data],

Thanks for getting back to us on this one, I can imagine you've had quite a few emails on this over the past few days

A quick follow up query from me in relation to the official response and some of the increasing traction this seems to be getting in various media outlets.

I appreciate Oracle are stating 'there has been no breach of Oracle Cloud' but is there any chance there has been a breach of something that isn't officially classed as 'Oracle Cloud'?

CloudSec appear to have issued an update validating their claims as can be seen here:

Part 2: Validating the Breach Oracle Cloud Denied – CloudSEK's Follow-Up Analysis | CloudSEK

Does Oracle's official position remain the same on the back of this?

Are you able to confirm the actions Oracle have taken on the back of this alleged breach to ensure it is not legitimate?

[Redacted 30(c), prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs]

Thanks in advance

**Cc:** [Multiple redacted emails]  
**Subject:** RE: [External] : Alleged Oracle Data Breach

Hi [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data],

Thank you for your email.

We are naturally receiving multiple queries from teams and information security officers across the 32 public bodies we provide a service to as well as conducting our own analysis. Naturally, this would lead to multiple enquiries from multiple different parts of the business each with their own vested interest. I appreciate this could mean you have received the same question multiple times over the last two days we too are receiving a high volume of enquiries relating to this alleged breach.

For SG colleagues, further queries should be routed through the service management contract management function, which is myself, [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]We will co-ordinate requests and queries to the correct area of Oracle, noting this may not always be [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]. Once a response is received, we will then share back to colleagues across the multiple affected business areas.

At this point, it would also be useful to remind colleagues both Oracle and Scottish Government on the contractual position here:

[Redacted 33(1)(b), commercial interests]

And from the data processing agreement, which forms part of data processing schedules and is referenced throughout the contract as well as the Oracle Information Security Incident Reporting and Response Policy:

"9.2 Oracle will notify you of a confirmed Information Breach without undue delay but at the latest within 24 hours. As information regarding the Information Breach is collected or otherwise reasonably becomes available to Oracle, Oracle will also provide You with (i) a description of the nature and reasonably anticipated consequences of the Information Breach; (ii) the measures taken to mitigate any possible adverse effects and prevent a recurrence; and (iii) where possible, information about the types of information that were the subject of the Information Breach. You agree to coordinate with Oracle on the content of Your intended public statements or required notices for the affected Individuals and/or notices to the relevant Regulators regarding the Information Breach."

Happy to discuss.

Thanks

## Update to Ministers and Responses – 27 March

**From:** [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data] On Behalf Of Brian Reid  
**Sent:** 27 March 2025 16:53  
**To:** Cabinet Secretary for Finance & Local Government; Minister for Public Finance  
**Cc:** Permanent Secretary; Lesley Fraser; Brian Reid; Heather Carson; [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]  
**Subject:** Update on alleged Oracle Cloud data breach

Cabinet Secretary for Finance & Local Government  
Minister for Public Finance

There were reports on Saturday 21 March 2025 of an alleged breach of Oracle's Cloud environment. Oracle Cloud is the HR, Finance and Purchasing platform used by Scottish Government and 32 public bodies. There is some doubt as to the veracity of the claim. However, the claim has been backed by a number of reputable security researchers.

Oracle has so far denied any breach and stated that no Oracle Cloud customer experienced a breach or loss of data.

The Scottish Cyber Coordination Centre (SC3) has engaged the NCSC and UK Government Cyber Coordination Centre with a view to establishing facts around this alleged incident.

In an abundance of caution and to reduce any potential impact if a breach has indeed occurred, Scottish Government Cyber Security have recommended we follow the advice from NCC Group, who are one of the leading cyber security companies in the world, to take steps to minimise the potential for any threat.

Scottish Government officials met this morning to agree how to take forward these preventative actions, and that work has now commenced. These precautionary steps will have minimal impact on the running of Oracle Cloud and no impact to the business of the Scottish Government and customer organisations.

Whilst this incident has not yet been picked up by any of the mainstream media outlets, some of our Oracle Cloud corporate clients have contacted the Corporate Hub seeking an update. Our response has been, "We're aware of reports over the weekend of an alleged breach of Oracle's Cloud environment. Oracle has denied this. We have had our own teams and partners looking into this issue since we were made aware on Saturday and to date have found no evidence of any breach of our environment."

An updated FMQ note was submitted yesterday 26 March 2025 and will continue to be updated in line with any emerging developments. We will also issue communications to our 32 corporate client customers to advise them of our latest position.

Brian Reid

Good afternoon,

You may have seen reports this week about an unconfirmed data breach of Oracle's Cloud environment. I wanted to update you that we are monitoring the situation closely and liaising with the Scottish Cyber Coordination Centre (SC3). Oracle has denied any breach. We are following advice from Scottish Government's Cyber Security colleagues to implement precautionary steps, as recommended by SC3. There are no actions that customers need to take at this time.

Morning Heather

I've just received an updated [Redacted 30(c), prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs] notice which, worded carefully, does cast significant doubt on Oracle's denial. I'm conscious you'll be v busy on this and you may be working on a message for all shared services customers. Obviously the new [Redacted 30(c), prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs]notice is a concern to us, and I'd be grateful if you could share an update – either in response to me or a general update to customers – on SG's understanding of the position.

Thanks

**Cc:** Michael Cameron [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data]@shr.gov.scot  
**Subject:** RE: [Redacted 30(c), prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs] - ALLEGED INCIDENT INDICATING A BREACH OF ORACLE CLOUD

Hi [Redacted 38(1)(b), personal data], Heather and I have discussed with Cyber colleagues this morning and they have confirmed that the latest [Redacted 30(c), prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs] notice does not fundamentally change the position, and the notice was to provide a further update given the developments yesterday of some additional data released by the threat actor.

The position therefore remains that our teams and partners are continuing to look into this issue since we were made aware on Saturday and to date have found no evidence of any breach of our environment. Oracle's position remains unchanged.

We will continue to work with Oracle and others on this in the coming days.

Kind Regards,
