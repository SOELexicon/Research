# Entity - China Digital Yuan (e-CNY)

## Overview
China's Central Bank Digital Currency system representing the world's most advanced and scaled implementation of programmable money integrated with comprehensive state surveillance, serving as the final data layer for China's Social Credit System while demonstrating the full potential of CBDCs as instruments of social engineering and population control.
