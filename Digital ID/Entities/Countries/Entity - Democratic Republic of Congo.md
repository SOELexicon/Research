# Democratic Republic of Congo

## Overview
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a Central African nation whose digital ID project exemplifies [[Finding - Digital Public Infrastructure as Digital Colonialism]]â€”where implementation costs **spiraled from $360 million to $1.2 billion** amid foreign technology supplier disputes, demonstrating how "development" projects become vehicles for profit extraction.

## Basic Information
- **Official Name**: Democratic Republic of the Congo
- **Capital**: Kinshasa
- **Population**: ~105 million (Africa's 4th most populous)
- **Region**: Central Africa

## [[Entity - Congo Digital ID Project]]

### [[Event - Congo Digital ID Cost Spiral 360M to 1.2B]]
**Initial Budget**: $360 million
**Final Cost**: $1.2 billion
**Increase**: 233%

**System Scope:**
- Biometric enrollment for 105 million residents
- National ID card production
- Voter registration database
- Systems integration

### Cost Drivers
- Vendor disputes and competing contracts
- Foreign technology supplier conflicts
- Scope expansion
- "Necessary" system upgrades
- Ongoing maintenance provisions

## Digital Colonialism Pattern

### [[Finding - Digital Public Infrastructure as Digital Colonialism]]
The Congo case exemplifies:
1. **Western Platforms**: "Free" software from Western institutions
2. **Dependency Creation**: Implementation requires foreign expertise
3. **Profit Extraction**: Billions flow to multinational corporations
4. **Sovereignty Erosion**: Critical infrastructure dependent on foreign companies

### Foreign Vendor Ecosystem
Expensive implementation requires:
- Biometric hardware ([[Entity - Thales]], [[Entity - Idemia]])
- Systems integration ([[Entity - Accenture]], [[Entity - Deloitte]])
- Technical consulting
- Training and capacity building
- Ongoing maintenance

### Government Leverage Deficit
DRC government lacks:
- Technical expertise to arbitrate vendor disputes
- Bargaining power against multinationals
- Alternative suppliers for proprietary systems
- Ability to complete project without vendor cooperation

## World Bank Role

### [[Entity - World Bank ID4D Program]]
World Bank promotes digital ID in developing nations:
- Technical assistance to DRC
- Funding mechanisms
- Vendor ecosystem connections
- "Best practices" favoring expensive Western systems

### Debt Implications
$1.2 billion cost creates:
- National debt increase
- Budget constraints on health, education
- IMF/World Bank conditionalities
- Continued dependency on external financing
