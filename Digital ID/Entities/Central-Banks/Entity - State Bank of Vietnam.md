# Entity - State Bank of Vietnam

## Overview
Vietnam's central bank that implemented the world's largest mass financial exclusion event in 2025, mandating facial biometric authentication for all bank accounts and subsequently freezing or closing 86 million accounts (43% of national total) for non-compliance, establishing a critical blueprint for enforcing CBDC and digital identity adoption through financial coercion.

### Executive Management
- **Governor**: Central bank chief executive and policy implementation
- **Deputy Governors**: Multiple deputies overseeing specific operational areas
- **Board of Directors**: Policy formulation and strategic direction
- **Supervisory Board**: Internal audit and compliance oversight

### Digital Identity Implementation
- **Biometric Authentication Unit**: Department coordinating facial recognition mandate
- **Digital Banking Division**: Overseeing digital transformation and compliance enforcement
- **Anti-Money Laundering Department**: Official justification framework for biometric requirements
- **Commercial Bank Coordination**: Managing implementation across financial institutions

## 2025 Mass De-Banking Event

### Biometric Authentication Mandate
- **Implementation Date**: September 1, 2025
- **Requirement**: Facial biometric scanning for all existing bank accounts
- **Compliance Method**: In-person bank branch visits for biometric enrollment
- **Official Justification**: Combating financial fraud and AI-generated deepfake scams
- **Legal Authority**: Circular 17/2024/TT-NHNN establishing mandatory biometric requirements

### Scale and Impact
- **Accounts Affected**: 86 million bank accounts frozen or closed
- **Population Impact**: Approximately 43% of nation's 200 million accounts
- **Geographic Scope**: Nationwide implementation across all commercial banks
- **Compliance Deadline**: Hard deadline with no extensions or exemptions granted
- **Economic Disruption**: Massive financial exclusion event affecting nearly half of banking population

### Exclusion Mechanisms
- **Automatic Freezing**: Non-compliant accounts immediately rendered inaccessible
- **Account Termination**: Permanent closure of accounts failing biometric requirements
- **Fund Inaccessibility**: Customer funds trapped in frozen accounts pending compliance
- **No Remote Options**: In-person verification requirement with no alternatives

## Implementation Methodology

### Coercive Enforcement Strategy
- **Hard Deadline**: September 1, 2025 compliance date creating crisis urgency
- **Universal Mandate**: No exemptions for elderly, disabled, or overseas citizens
- **Financial Hostage**: Funds held inaccessible until biometric compliance achieved
- **Public Narrative**: "System cleanup" targeting inactive and fraudulent accounts

### Disproportionate Impact Demographics
- **Foreign Residents**: Expatriates required to return to Vietnam for verification
- **Migrant Workers**: Overseas workers losing access to remittance accounts
- **Rural Populations**: Limited access to bank branches for biometric enrollment
- **Elderly Citizens**: Technology and mobility barriers preventing compliance
- **Disabled Individuals**: Physical and cognitive disabilities creating enrollment obstacles

### State Control Implementation
- **Identity Verification**: Mandatory linking of financial access to government biometric database
- **Surveillance Infrastructure**: Facial recognition data collection for state monitoring
- **Economic Coercion**: Financial system weaponized for identity system compliance
- **Population Control**: Mass exclusion demonstrating state power over economic participation

## Strategic Significance
