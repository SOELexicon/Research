# National Institute of Standards and Technology

## Overview
NIST is a U.S. government agency within the Department of Commerce that develops technology standards and conducts critical research on biometric systems and cryptography. NIST research has documented [[Finding - Facial Recognition Accuracy Disparity by Race Gender Age]] and is leading the standardization of [[Event - NIST PQC Algorithm Standardization]] to protect against quantum computing threats.

## Biometric Research
**Findings:**
- **Demographic Bias**: Facial recognition algorithms exhibit higher error rates for women, people of color (particularly Black and Asian individuals), and the elderly
- **Accuracy Disparities**: [[Finding - Biometric Technology Demographic Bias Pattern]]
- **[[Entity - Government Accountability Office]]** corroboration

## Post-Quantum Cryptography
**[[Event - NIST PQC Algorithm Standardization]]:**
- **CRYSTALS-Kyber**: Encryption algorithm
- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**: Digital signature algorithm
- **Urgency**: Current encryption vulnerable to future quantum computers
- **Transition Challenge**: [[Finding - Post-Quantum Cryptography Transition Vulnerability]]
