# Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat

## Executive Summary
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) is the administrative arm of the Treasury Board, Canada's central management agency responsible for accountability and ethics, financial, personnel and administrative management, comptrollership, procurement, and information management in the federal government. Despite its mandate, TBS has been heavily criticized by the Auditor General for making "little progress" in leading the development of a cohesive national digital identity framework, contributing to Canada's fragmented and insecure digital ID landscape.

## Digital ID Leadership Failure
### Auditor General Criticism (December 2024)
- **Assessment**: "Little progress" in developing national digital ID approach
- **Root Causes**: Lack of dedicated funding and clear strategy
- **International Comparison**: Canada lags G7 peers with national legislation
- **Ranking Decline**: Canada fell from 3rd (2010) to 32nd (2022) in UN E-Government Development Index

### Consequences of Inaction
- **Provincial Fragmentation**: Provinces developing incompatible systems
- **Security Risks**: No national framework for security standards
- **Interoperability Issues**: Systems cannot communicate across jurisdictions
- **Economic Costs**: Duplicated efforts and reduced efficiency gains

### Resource Constraints
- **Funding Gap**: Insufficient dedicated resources for digital ID leadership
- **Strategic Vacuum**: No clear federal strategy or roadmap
- **Coordination Failure**: Unable to align federal-provincial digital ID efforts
- **International Lag**: Behind other G7 nations in digital government development

## Organizational Structure
### Leadership
- **President of Treasury Board**: Political head, Cabinet minister
- **Secretary of Treasury Board**: Deputy Minister level, administrative head
- **Assistant Deputy Ministers**: Various functional areas including digital government

### Key Divisions
- **Digital Government**: Responsible for digital ID policy (underperforming)
- **Comptrollership**: Financial oversight and controls
- **People Management**: Public service HR policies
- **Regulatory Affairs**: Federal regulatory policy coordination

## Digital ID Policy Framework
### Current Status
- **Federal Role**: Minimal leadership despite mandate
- **Policy Development**: Lacking comprehensive national framework
- **Standards Setting**: No binding national digital ID standards
- **Provincial Coordination**: Ineffective federal-provincial alignment

### Missed Opportunities
- **National Legislation**: No federal digital ID act or framework law
- **Single Sign-On**: No unified federal digital identity system
- **International Leadership**: Falling behind G7 digital government initiatives
- **Economic Benefits**: Delayed realization of $15 billion potential value

## Relationship to Digital ID Ecosystem
### Federal Departments
- **Coordination Role**: Should coordinate across federal departments (failing)
- **Policy Integration**: Digital ID should integrate with broader digital government
- **Service Delivery**: Digital ID enables better federal service access

### Provincial Relations
- **Framework Setting**: Should provide interoperability standards
- **Best Practices**: Should facilitate provincial knowledge sharing
- **Technical Standards**: Should ensure compatible technical specifications

### Private Sector
- **Industry Engagement**: Limited consultation with technology sector
- **Standards Development**: Minimal involvement in private sector standards
- **Economic Impact**: Not effectively leveraging private sector capabilities

## Intelligence Assessment
### Organizational Capacity
- **Technical Expertise**: Limited specialized digital ID knowledge
- **Policy Development**: Weak strategic planning and implementation
- **Federal Coordination**: Poor cross-departmental leadership
- **Resource Allocation**: Insufficient funding for digital transformation

### Political Constraints
- **Ministerial Priorities**: Digital ID not prioritized by political leadership
- **Federal-Provincial Tensions**: Reluctance to assert federal leadership
- **Economic Focus**: Immediate affordability issues overshadow digital policy
- **Public Trust**: Low government approval affects complex tech initiatives

## Reform Requirements
### Immediate Needs
- **Dedicated Funding**: Substantial budget allocation for digital ID leadership
- **Strategic Framework**: Comprehensive national digital ID strategy
- **Technical Standards**: Binding interoperability and security requirements
- **Provincial Coordination**: Regular federal-provincial digital ID meetings

### Structural Changes
- **Specialized Unit**: Dedicated digital ID policy and implementation team
- **External Expertise**: Recruitment of digital identity technical specialists
- **Industry Engagement**: Formal private sector consultation mechanisms
- **International Coordination**: Active participation in G7 digital ID initiatives

## Impact on Digital ID Development
### Negative Effects
- **Leadership Vacuum**: Provincial systems developing without coordination
- **Security Gaps**: No national security framework or standards
- **Economic Inefficiency**: Duplicated provincial efforts and reduced benefits
- **International Reputation**: Canada seen as laggard in digital government

### Future Implications
- **System Integration**: Increasingly difficult to create interoperable systems
- **Cost Escalation**: More expensive to retrofit compatibility later
- **Citizen Confusion**: Multiple incompatible systems reduce user adoption
- **Cybersecurity Risks**: Fragmented approach creates vulnerabilities

## Recommendations for Reform
### Short-term Actions
1. **Emergency Funding**: Immediate budget allocation for digital ID coordination
2. **Federal Strategy**: Develop comprehensive national digital ID framework
3. **Provincial Engagement**: Launch federal-provincial digital ID working group
4. **International Benchmarking**: Study G7 best practices and lessons learned

### Long-term Structural Changes
1. **Legislative Framework**: Develop federal digital ID enabling legislation
2. **Standards Authority**: Create binding national digital ID standards
3. **Technical Expertise**: Build specialized digital ID policy capacity
4. **Public Engagement**: Launch national consultation on digital ID development

## Open Questions
- [ ] Will new Carney government provide necessary resources and mandate?
- [ ] Can TBS develop digital ID expertise quickly enough to catch up?
- [ ] How will federal-provincial jurisdiction issues be resolved?
- [ ] What role will private sector play in national framework?
