# Auditor General of Canada

## Executive Summary
The Office of the Auditor General of Canada (OAG) is an independent parliamentary oversight body responsible for auditing federal government operations and providing objective information to Parliament about government performance. In December 2024, the OAG delivered a scathing critique of the federal government's digital identity leadership, finding that the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat has made "little progress" in developing a cohesive national approach, contributing to Canada's declining international standing in digital government.
