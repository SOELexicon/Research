# Pan-Canadian Trust Framework

## Executive Summary
The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) is a comprehensive set of standards and guidelines developed by the Digital ID & Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) to ensure that digital identity services across Canada are secure, private, and interoperable. In the absence of federal government leadership, the PCTF has emerged as the de facto national standard for digital ID implementation, formally adopted as Canada's national digital identity standard (CAN/DGSI 103-0:2025) in August 2025.

## Framework Details
- **Official Name**: Pan-Canadian Trust Framework
- **Type**: Digital Identity Standards Framework
