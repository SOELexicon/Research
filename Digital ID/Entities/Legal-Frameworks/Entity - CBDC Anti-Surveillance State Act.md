# CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act

## Overview
The CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act is proposed U.S. legislation that explicitly seeks to **prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**, citing risks to the Fourth Amendment and the potential for the government to monitor and control citizens' financial behavior. The Act exemplifies legislative resistance to the [[Investigation - CBDC Programmable Money and Financial Surveillance Infrastructure]] and [[Investigation - Digital Identity-Industrial Complex Global Architecture]].

## Legislative Details
- **Country**: [[Entity - United States]]
- **Status**: Proposed (not yet enacted)
- **Year**: First introduced 2023
- **Primary Sponsor**: Multiple members of Congress (bipartisan concern)
- **Objective**: Prohibit Federal Reserve from issuing retail CBDC

## Core Arguments

### Privacy and Fourth Amendment Concerns
**Constitutional Basis:**
- **Fourth Amendment**: Protection against unreasonable searches and seizures
- **Financial Privacy**: CBDC would create permanent transaction surveillance
- **[[Finding - CBDC Financial Surveillance Centralized Architecture]]**: Every transaction traceable

**Specific Concerns:**
- **Digital Trail**: Cash transactions are anonymous; CBDC transactions create permanent records
- **Government Access**: Federal agencies could query transaction databases
- **Chilling Effect**: Knowledge of surveillance alters behavior (First Amendment implications)

### Control and Programmability Concerns
**[[Finding - CBDC Programmable Money Control Mechanisms]]:**
- **Freeze/Confiscate**: Government could directly freeze or seize digital currency
- **Spending Restrictions**: [[Finding - CBDC Programmable Money Ex-Ante vs Ex-Post Control]]
- **Political Targeting**: Limit donations to disfavored groups
- **Prohibited Purchases**: Prevent purchases of certain goods

### Social Credit System Concerns
**Fear of [[Entity - China Social Credit System]] Model:**
- **Behavioral Control**: Financial access tied to "social credit score"
- **Automated Punishment**: Algorithmic restrictions on economic activity
- **No Due Process**: Automated enforcement without judicial review

## Prohibited Activities

### Federal Reserve Restrictions
The Act would prohibit the Fed from:
- **Direct Retail CBDC**: Issuing digital currency directly to individuals
- **Central Account Management**: Managing individual accounts
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Direct surveillance of citizens' financial activity

### Indirect Implementation
Also seeks to prevent:
- **Intermediated Models**: Using banks as intermediaries for Fed surveillance
- **Pilot Programs**: Testing retail CBDC systems
- **Mandate Preparation**: Preparatory work for future CBDC rollout

## Political Landscape

### Bipartisan Concerns
CBDC surveillance concerns span political spectrum:
- **Right**: Government overreach, individual liberty, financial privacy
- **Left**: Corporate surveillance, economic justice, unbanked populations
- **Libertarian**: Maximum government monitoring opposition

### Opposition to Act
**Proponents of CBDC argue:**
- **Financial Inclusion**: CBDC could bank the unbanked
- **Efficiency**: Faster, cheaper payments
- **Monetary Sovereignty**: Counter to private cryptocurrencies
- **Existing Surveillance**: Banks already monitor transactions for AML/CFT

## Connection to Digital ID

### CBDC-Digital ID Nexus
[[Entity - Bank for International Settlements]] and [[Entity - Financial Action Task Force]] recognize:
- **KYC Requirements**: CBDC requires robust digital identity
- **AML/CFT Compliance**: Identity verification for financial transactions
- **[[Finding - CBDC Retail Two-Tier Intermediated Architecture]]**: Intermediaries perform identity verification

### Resistance to Full Architecture
The Act represents resistance to complete Digital Identity-Industrial Complex:
- **CBDC**: Programmable money, financial surveillance
- **Digital ID**: Identity layer for CBDC
- **Combined**: Unprecedented control over economic activity

## Comparison to Other Approaches

### vs. EU Digital Euro with Privacy
**[[Entity - European Central Bank]]** digital euro proposals include:
- **Privacy by design**: Offline transactions for small amounts
- **[[Entity - GDPR]]** compliance: Strong data protection
- **Limited government access**: Privacy protections even for online transactions

**U.S. Act**: Rejects retail CBDC entirely rather than regulate privacy

### vs. China's e-CNY
**[[Entity - China Digital Yuan (e-CNY)]]:**
- **Controllable Anonymity**: State can de-anonymize any transaction
- **No Privacy Protections**: Integrated with surveillance state
- **[[Finding - China e-CNY Controllable Anonymity Design]]**

**U.S. Act**: Explicit rejection of this model

## Current Status & Future

### Legislative Progress
- **Multiple Introductions**: Reintroduced in successive Congressional sessions
- **Committee Consideration**: Hearings on CBDC risks
- **Partisan Divide**: Debate on need for prohibition vs. privacy regulations
- **Federal Reserve Position**: Fed exploring CBDC but no immediate plans for retail issuance

### Alternative Approaches
Instead of outright prohibition, alternatives include:
- **Privacy Regulations**: Mandate privacy-preserving CBDC design
- **Judicial Oversight**: Require warrants for transaction queries
- **Purpose Limitations**: Prohibit programmability for social control
- **Cash Preservation**: Maintain physical currency as alternative
