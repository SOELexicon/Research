# Convention on Biological Diversity

## Overview
The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is a multilateral treaty with 196 parties that has established a de facto moratorium on geoengineering activities affecting biodiversity. Through decisions at Conferences of Parties (COPs), the CBD has created the most significant international legal constraint on geoengineering deployment, requiring that climate-related geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity should not take place until adequate scientific understanding and consideration of associated risks and impacts exist, alongside effective governance mechanisms.

## Legal Framework Details
- **Full Name**: Convention on Biological Diversity
- **Adopted**: June 5, 1992 (Rio Earth Summit)
- **Entered into Force**: December 29, 1993

- **Depositary**: United Nations Secretary-General
- **Legal Status**: International treaty binding on state parties

## Treaty Objectives and Structure
### Primary Objectives
- **Conservation**: Conservation of biological diversity

- **Benefit Sharing**: Fair and equitable sharing of genetic resource benefits
- **Ecosystem Protection**: Comprehensive approach to biodiversity conservation

### Institutional Framework
- **Conference of the Parties (COP)**: Supreme decision-making body
- **Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA)**: Scientific advisory body
- **Secretariat**: Administrative and coordination functions

- **Strategic Plans**: Global biodiversity conservation targets and goals

## Geoengineering Moratorium Development
### COP 10 Decision X/33 (2010)
- **Initial Moratorium**: First international restriction on geoengineering activities
- **Scope**: Climate-related geoengineering affecting biodiversity
- **Conditions**: Prohibition until adequate scientific understanding exists
- **Exceptions**: Small-scale scientific research in controlled settings

### COP 11 Decision XI/20 (2012)
- **Moratorium Strengthening**: Reinforcement of geoengineering restrictions
- **Marine Geoengineering**: Specific attention to ocean-based interventions
- **Scientific Research**: Continued allowance for limited research activities
- **Governance Requirements**: Need for effective governance mechanisms

### COP 13 Decision XIII/14 (2016)
- **Reaffirmation**: Continued support for geoengineering moratorium
- **Climate Engineering**: Expanded scope to include various intervention technologies
- **Risk Assessment**: Emphasis on comprehensive risk evaluation requirements
- **Governance Mechanisms**: Stronger requirements for effective oversight

### COP 15 Decision XV/31 (2022)
- **Latest Reaffirmation**: Most recent confirmation of geoengineering restrictions
- **Biodiversity Framework**: Integration with Global Biodiversity Framework
- **Scientific Understanding**: Continued requirements for adequate knowledge
- **Effective Governance**: Strengthened governance mechanism requirements

## Legal Scope and Interpretation
### Activities Covered
- **Climate-Related Geoengineering**: Interventions intended to address climate change
- **Biodiversity Effects**: Activities that may affect biological diversity
- **Ecosystem Interventions**: Direct ecosystem manipulation and modification
- **Large-Scale Activities**: Interventions beyond small-scale research

### Jurisdictional Application
- **National Territories**: Application within party state boundaries
- **International Areas**: Potential application to areas beyond national jurisdiction
- **Transboundary Effects**: Activities affecting biodiversity across borders
- **Global Commons**: Uncertain application to atmospheric and oceanic interventions

### Exceptions and Limitations
- **Small-Scale Research**: Permitted scientific research in controlled settings
- **National Sovereignty**: Limitation by state authority over natural resources
- **Emergency Situations**: Unclear application during climate emergencies
- **Enforcement Gaps**: Limited mechanisms for preventing violations

## Stratospheric Aerosol Injection Analysis
### Legal Status Under CBD
- **Biodiversity Effects**: SAI would significantly affect biological diversity globally
- **Moratorium Application**: SAI clearly covered by geoengineering restrictions
- **Research Limitations**: Outdoor SAI experiments potentially prohibited
- **Deployment Prohibition**: Large-scale SAI deployment legally constrained

### Implementation Challenges
- **National Enforcement**: Reliance on domestic implementation and enforcement
- **International Coordination**: Limited mechanisms for cross-border enforcement
- **Commercial Activities**: Unclear authority over private sector interventions
- **Monitoring Systems**: Inadequate verification and compliance mechanisms

### Governance Requirements
- **Scientific Understanding**: Need for comprehensive SAI impact assessment
- **Risk Evaluation**: Systematic evaluation of biodiversity consequences
- **Governance Mechanisms**: Effective oversight and accountability systems
- **Democratic Participation**: Public and stakeholder consultation requirements

## Effectiveness and Limitations
### Achievements
- **International Consensus**: Broad agreement on geoengineering restrictions
- **Legal Foundation**: Strongest international legal constraint on geoengineering
- **Scientific Standards**: Requirements for adequate understanding before deployment
- **Governance Framework**: Emphasis on effective oversight mechanisms

### Limitations and Gaps
- **Enforcement Weakness**: Limited mechanisms for preventing violations
- **Scope Ambiguity**: Unclear boundaries of prohibited activities
- **National Implementation**: Reliance on domestic legal systems
- **Emergency Exceptions**: Potential climate emergency bypass

### Compliance and Monitoring
- **Self-Reporting**: Reliance on voluntary national reporting
- **Peer Review**: Limited peer assessment of compliance
- **Scientific Advisory**: SBSTTA advice on geoengineering developments
- **Civil Society Monitoring**: NGO and academic compliance assessment

## Commercial Geoengineering Cases
### Make Sunsets Operations
- **Legal Violation**: Unauthorized SAI activities potentially violating CBD moratorium
- **Enforcement Gap**: No effective mechanism for preventing commercial deployment
- **National Jurisdiction**: Unclear authority over private sector activities
- **International Coordination**: Limited cooperation in compliance enforcement

### Research Activities
- **SCoPEx Cancellation**: Harvard project cancellation partially due to CBD constraints
- **Outdoor Experiments**: Uncertainty over permissible research activities
- **International Research**: Cross-border research coordination challenges
- **Commercial Research**: Private sector research potentially violating moratorium

## Scientific and Technical Assessment
### Biodiversity Impact Research
- **Ecosystem Effects**: Research on geoengineering impacts on biological systems
- **Species Responses**: Assessment of intervention effects on wildlife populations
- **Habitat Modification**: Evaluation of ecosystem habitat changes
- **Evolutionary Pressures**: Long-term impacts on species adaptation and evolution

### Risk Assessment Framework
- **Impact Evaluation**: Systematic assessment of biodiversity consequences
- **Uncertainty Analysis**: Evaluation of unknown and unpredictable effects
- **Threshold Determination**: Identification of acceptable risk levels
- **Monitoring Requirements**: Systems for detecting and assessing impacts

### Governance Mechanism Development
