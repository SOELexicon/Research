# eIDAS 2.0 Regulation

## Overview
The eIDAS 2.0 Regulation (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) is the updated [[Entity - European Union]] legal framework that **mandates all 27 member states offer citizens a European Digital Identity Wallet ([[Entity - EU EUDI Wallet]]) by 2026**. Unlike authoritarian digital ID systems, eIDAS 2.0 establishes a **voluntary, privacy-preserving, user-controlled** model grounded in [[Entity - GDPR]] principles.

## Legal Details
- **Jurisdiction**: [[Entity - European Union]] (27 member states)
- **Enacted**: 2024
- **Entry into Force**: [[Event - EU eIDAS 2.0 Regulation Entry into Force]]
- **Member State Compliance Deadline**: 2026
- **Legal Basis**: EU Regulation (directly applicable in all member states)

## Mandate

### All Member States Must Offer EUDI Wallet
By 2026, every EU member state must provide citizens with:
- **Digital Identity Wallet**: Mobile app for identity credentials
- **Interoperability**: Recognized across all 27 member states
- **Public & Private Acceptance**: Usable for government and private services

### Voluntary Adoption
**Critical Distinction**: Unlike mandatory systems ([[Entity - India Aadhaar System]], [[Entity - Vietnam Project 06]]), eIDAS 2.0 mandates **availability** not **use**:
- Citizens can choose whether to adopt wallet
- Non-digital alternatives must remain accessible
- Cannot be denied services for non-use

### Core Principles Mandated by eIDAS 2.0

**1. User Control**
- **Local Data Storage**: Identity data on user's device, not central database
- **Selective Disclosure**: Share only necessary attributes
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and share minimum required data
- **User Consent**: Explicit permission for each data sharing

**2. Privacy by Design**
- **No Central Database**: No EU-wide or national biometric repository
- **Pseudonymization**: Online transactions use pseudonymized data
- **Offline Functionality**: Cash-like privacy for small transactions
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove attribute without revealing underlying data

**3. Legal Safeguards**
- **[[Entity - GDPR]] Compliance**: Full alignment with EU data protection law
- **Right to Erasure**: Users can delete data
- **Data Portability**: Transfer data between providers
- **Strong Enforcement**: Penalties for violations

## Comparison to Other Legal Frameworks

### vs. US REAL ID Act
**eIDAS 2.0**: Voluntary, privacy-preserving, user-controlled
**[[Entity - US REAL ID Act]]**: Federal coercion, biometric standardization, security-first

### vs. China's Legal Framework
**eIDAS 2.0**: Rights-based, voluntary, strong privacy protections
**[[Entity - China Social Credit System]]**: Mandatory, surveillance-oriented, punishment-based

### vs. India's Aadhaar Act
**eIDAS 2.0**: Decentralized, no central database, voluntary
**India**: Centralized biometric database, [[Finding - Aadhaar Function Creep Voluntary to Mandatory]]

## Technical Standards

### Interoperability Requirements
eIDAS 2.0 mandates:
- **W3C Standards**: Verifiable Credentials Data Model
- **Common Formats**: QR codes, digital signatures
- **Attribute Standards**: Standardized identity attributes across EU
- **Security**: Public key infrastructure, encryption standards

### Implementation Flexibility
Member states can:
- Choose wallet provider (public or private sector)
- Select underlying technology platforms
- Customize user interface
- Add national-specific credentials

## Governance

### European Commission
- Overall coordination
- Technical standards development
- Monitoring compliance
- Enforcement mechanisms

### Member States
- Issue digital identity wallets to citizens
- Credential issuance (passports, driver's licenses, diplomas)
- National implementation
- Compliance with privacy standards

### Data Protection Authorities
- Enforcement of [[Entity - GDPR]] compliance
- Privacy impact assessments
- Investigation of violations
- Penalties for non-compliance

## Use Cases Enabled

### Cross-Border Services
- Travel within EU without physical documents
- Access to public services in any member state
- Cross-border healthcare
- Educational credential recognition

### Private Sector
- Age verification without revealing birthdate
- Banking KYC with selective disclosure
- Employment verification
- Rental agreements

## Tensions and Risks

### Law Enforcement Pressure
Despite privacy design, pressure exists for:
- Backdoor access to encrypted data
- Real-time tracking capabilities
- Reduced anonymity for criminal investigations

### [[Finding - Function Creep Welfare to Surveillance Repurposing]]
Even voluntary systems risk:
- Future mandates by different governments
- Gradual elimination of non-digital alternatives
- Integration with surveillance systems
- Corporate discrimination against non-users

### Implementation Challenges
- **27 Different Systems**: Coordination complexity
- **Technical Interoperability**: Standards implementation
- **User Adoption**: Convincing citizens to use voluntary system
- **Cost**: Public funding for development and maintenance
