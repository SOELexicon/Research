# Entity - Vietnam Project 06

## Executive Summary
Vietnamese government digital identity program that mandated biometric verification for all banking services, resulting in the closure of 86 million bank accounts (43% of Vietnam's population) for biometric non-compliance, demonstrating the most extensive financial exclusion event in digital ID history.

## Organizational Details
- **Legal Name**: Dự án 06 (Project 06)
- **Type**: Government Digital Identity Program
- **Founded**: 2016 (implementation 2021-2024)
- **Headquarters**: [[Hanoi, Vietnam]]
- **Legal Framework**: Decree 59/2022/ND-CP
- **Implementation**: State Bank of Vietnam coordination

## Program Structure
### Leadership
- **Program Director**: State Bank of Vietnam Governor
- **Technical Implementation**: Ministry of Public Security
- **Database Management**: National Population Database Authority
- **Compliance Oversight**: Banking supervision departments

### Implementation Phases
- **Phase 1 (2021)**: Pilot implementation in major cities
- **Phase 2 (2022)**: National rollout to all banks
- **Phase 3 (2023-2024)**: Enforcement and account closures
- **Ongoing**: Biometric verification maintenance

### Legal Authority
- **Decree 59/2022/ND-CP**: Biometric banking mandate
- **Circular 17/2024/TT-NHNN**: Account closure procedures
- **Data Protection Law**: Modified for security exemptions
- **Banking Law**: Updated for digital identity requirements

## Business Operations

### Biometric Banking Requirements
- **Mandatory Verification**: All bank accounts require biometric linking
- **Identity Database**: National population database integration
- **Real-time Checking**: Continuous verification systems
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Account closure for non-compliance

### Mass Account Closure Implementation
- **Scale**: 86 million accounts closed (2024)
- **Population Impact**: 43% of Vietnam's total population
- **Vulnerable Groups**: Rural, elderly, disabled disproportionately affected
- **Economic Disruption**: Loss of financial services access

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Biometric Collection**: Fingerprint and facial recognition systems
- **Database Integration**: Cross-government data sharing
- **Banking System**: All financial institutions connected
- **Verification Networks**: Real-time identity checking

## Financial Information
- **Program Budget**: $500+ million (estimated)
- **Implementation Costs**: Government and banking sector shared
- **Technology Investment**: Biometric infrastructure development
- **Economic Impact**: Billions in lost economic activity from exclusions

## Implementation Results

### Account Closure Statistics
- **Total Closures**: 86 million bank accounts
- **Percentage Impact**: 43% of national population
- **Geographic Distribution**: Rural areas disproportionately affected
- **Demographic Impact**: Elderly and disabled highest failure rates

### Biometric Failure Rates
- **System Failures**: 15-25% biometric recognition failures
- **Population Exclusion**: Millions unable to meet biometric requirements
- **Appeals Process**: Limited recourse for affected individuals
- **Alternative Access**: No provision for non-biometric banking

### Economic Consequences
- **Financial Exclusion**: Loss of banking services for millions
- **Digital Payment**: Reduced access to digital financial services
- **Rural Impact**: Disproportionate effect on agricultural communities
- **Elderly Exclusion**: Age-related biometric difficulties
