# India Aadhaar System

## Executive Summary
World's largest biometric ID system covering 1.3 billion people, linked to 57 documented starvation deaths and systematic exclusion of vulnerable populations through 12% authentication failure rates.

## System Details
- **Legal Name**: Aadhaar (Foundation)
- **Type**: National Biometric Identity System
- **Launched**: 2009
- **Coverage**: 1.3+ billion enrolled
- **Operator**: [[Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)]]

## Technical Architecture
### Biometric Components
- Fingerprints (10 fingers)
- Iris scans (both eyes)  
- Facial photograph
- Demographic data

### Database Scale
- 12-digit unique identification number
- Links to 600+ government databases
- 50+ million daily authentications
- Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR)

## Implementation Scope
### Mandatory Services (Post-2016)
- Public Distribution System (food rations)
- Banking (KYC requirements)
- Mobile phone connections
- Tax filing (PAN linking)
- School admissions
- Welfare benefits (300+ schemes)

### Authentication Failure Rates
- National average: 12% (UIDAI admission)
- Jharkhand: 49% 
- Rajasthan: 37%
- Elderly/disabled: Up to 60%

## Human Impact & Casualties
### Documented Deaths (2015-2018)
- Total starvation deaths linked: 57
- 2017-2018 specific: 42 deaths
- Notable cases:
  - [[Santoshi Kumari]] - 11-year-old, died September 2017
  - [[Etwariya Devi]] - 67-year-old, died 2017
  
### Exclusion Statistics  
- 8.9 million SC/ST/OBC students denied scholarships
- 130+ million affected by authentication failures
- Manual laborers, elderly disproportionately excluded

## Security Breaches
- **2018**: Database for sale on WhatsApp for â‚¹500 ($7)
- **2024**: 815 million records on dark web for $80,000
- **Ongoing**: Unprotected APIs allowing unlimited queries

## Legal Challenges
### Puttaswamy Judgment (2018)
- Supreme Court limited mandatory use
- Declared privacy a fundamental right
- Government circumvented through indirect mandates

## Intelligence Assessment
### System Vulnerabilities
- Biometric data cannot be changed if compromised
- No opt-out mechanism
- Single point of failure for essential services

### Control Mechanisms
- Real-time tracking of all transactions
- Cross-database surveillance capability
- Automated benefit denial on auth failure

## Connections
- Model for [[Entity - World Bank ID4D Program]]
- Influenced [[Entity - Nigeria NIN System]]
- Integrated with [[India DigiLocker]]
- Enables [[India UPI Payment System]]
