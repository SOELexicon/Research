# Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity (SL-UDI)

## Overview
Sri Lanka's Unique Digital Identity initiative (SL-UDI) aims to replace the legacy paper National Identity Card with a biometric smart ID and digital wallet supporting e-government, social protection, and financial services. Spearheaded by the Ministry of Technology and Department for Registration of Persons (DRP), the program leverages financing from the [[Entity - World Bank ID4D Program]] ("Digital Economy for Sri Lanka" project) and technical assistance from India under an MoU signed in 2022.

## System Architecture
- **Biometrics**: Fingerprints, facial image, and demographic data captured via mobile enrollment kits.
- **Credential**: Contactless smart card with embedded secure element and companion mobile wallet.
- **Interoperability**: Designed to integrate with national payment switch (LankaPay), tax and revenue systems, and social welfare registries.
- **Platform**: Combination of MOSIP-inspired architecture and proprietary modules developed by Sri Lanka's ICT Agency (ICTA) with Indian vendors (e.g., L&T Technology Services, TechMahindra).

## Implementation Milestones
- **2021**: Cabinet approval for digital ID roadmap; establishment of National Digital Identity Committee.
- **2022**: India-Sri Lanka MoU signed during PM Modi visit; $300M line of credit for digital connectivity.
- **2023**: Procurement of biometric enrollment kits; pilot enrollment begins in Western Province.
- **2024**: Draft Digital Identity Bill tabled in Parliament; consultation with Data Protection Authority under Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA 2022).
- **2025 (Planned)**: National rollout targeting 17 million ID holders; integration with social welfare benefits under "Aswesuma" program.

## Governance
- **Ministry of Technology**: Policy oversight.
- **Department for Registration of Persons (DRP)**: Operational enrollment and card issuance.
- **Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA)**: Technical design and integration.
- **Data Protection Authority**: Ensures compliance with PDPA 2022.

## Partners & Funding

- [[Government of India]]: Technical assistance and funding for hardware/software through EXIM Bank credit line.

## Risks & Issues
