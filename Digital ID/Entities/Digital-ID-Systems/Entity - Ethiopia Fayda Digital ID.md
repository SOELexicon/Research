# Ethiopia Fayda Digital ID

## Overview
National biometric identification system administered by Ethiopia's National ID Program (NIDP), branded "Fayda" (meaning "value" in Amharic), designed to provide legal identity for 90 million residents by 2026 with support from [[Entity - World Bank ID4D Program]] and the [[Entity - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]].

## System Architecture
- **Data Collected**: Ten fingerprints, facial image, iris scan, demographic data, and residency details.
- **Core Platform**: Built on [[Entity - MOSIP Platform]] modules tailored for Ethiopian data residency requirements.
- **Authentication**: Offline QR credentials plus online API for banking, telecom, and social protection services.
- **Security**: Tier-III data center in Addis Ababa with disaster recovery site in Adama; PKI-based credential issuance.

## Implementation Timeline
### 2021-2022: Pilot Phase
- NIDP established under Prime Minister's Office; pilot enrollments in Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and Oromia.
- Issued 100,000 digital credentials to civil servants and bank customers.

### 2023-2024: Scale-Up
- Enrollment expands to 1,200+ registration centers with mobile kits.
- Integration completed with Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Dashen Bank, and telecommunication operator Ethio Telecom.
- Refugee registration pilot launched with UNHCR in Gambella camps.

### 2025+: Targeted Expansion
- Goal of 70% adult coverage by 2025 and full national coverage by 2026.
- Planned linkage to electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC), SIM registration, and national elections.

## Relationships & Partners
### Government Stakeholders
- **National ID Program (NIDP)** under the Office of the Prime Minister.

- [[Entity - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]]: Technical assistance and MOSIP funding.
- [[UNHCR]]: Humanitarian identity integration for refugees.
- [[African Development Bank]]: Co-financing digital government backbone.

### Technology Vendors
- [[Entity - MOSIP Platform]]: Core identity software.
- IDEMIA & Innovatrics: AFIS deduplication and biometric SDKs.

## Operational Status (2025)
- 12 million residents enrolled; 6 million digital credentials active.
- Used for e-KYC in more than 20 financial institutions and for civil service payroll validation.
- Pilot linkage underway with the digital cash transfer program "Productive Safety Net".

## Risk & Impact Assessment
- **Inclusion Risks**: Rural enrollment lagging; accessibility challenges for pastoralist communities.
- **Security Concerns**: Reliance on foreign biometric vendors requires continuous audits.
- **Governance**: NIDP governed by multi-stakeholder board with civil society oversight, but legislation for data protection still pending in Parliament.
- **Strategic Impact**: Considered cornerstone for Ethiopia's Digital Foundations agenda and fodder for regional interoperability (East African Community discussions).
