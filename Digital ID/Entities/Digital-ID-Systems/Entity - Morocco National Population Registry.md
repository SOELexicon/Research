# Morocco National Population Registry (RNP)

## Overview
Central biometric identification system managed by the Moroccan Ministry of Interior, designed to consolidate civil registration, social protection, and digital service delivery. The RNP underpins the Social Registry (RSU) and National Electronic Identity Card (CNIE) modernization, leveraging funding from the [[Entity - World Bank ID4D Program]] and European partners.

## System Architecture
- **Data Capture**: Biographic data, ten fingerprints, facial image.
- **Platform**: Based on [[Entity - MOSIP Platform]] components customized by Morocco's Digital Development Agency (ADD) with security enhancements to comply with Law 09-08 (data protection).
- **Identifiers**: Generates unique Civil and Social Digital Identifier (IDCS) linked to CNIE cards and RSU.
- **Authentication**: Multi-channel (card, QR code, mobile app) enabling online and offline verification for cash transfers and subsidy programs.

## Implementation Timeline
### 2017-2019: Foundation
- Legal framework established via Decree 2-17-410 creating RNP and RSU.
- Pilot enrollment in Rabat-Salé-Kénitra region; integration with national civil registry (RNPP).

### 2020-2023: Expansion
- World Bank provides $500M program-for-results financing (PForR) to scale registry and social protection reforms.
- CNIE 2.0 smart cards deployed nationwide; RNP enrollment surpasses 12 million residents.
- RSU digital social registry targets low-income households for subsidies (gas, flour, sugar).

### 2024-2025: Service Integration
- Government deploys Tayssir (education) and RAMED (healthcare) benefits through RNP-linked digital wallets.
- Private sector (banks, telecoms) begin e-KYC pilots using RNP API under supervision of Bank Al-Maghrib.

## Stakeholders & Governance
- **Ministry of Interior**: Lead agency overseeing RNP operations.
- **Digital Development Agency (ADD)**: Technical implementation and cyber security oversight.
- **National Commission for the Control of Personal Data Protection (CNDP)**: Regulatory compliance.
- **World Bank & European Union**: Financial and technical support, aligning with human development reforms.

## Strategic Objectives
- Improve targeting efficiency of social programs by 40%.
- Enable interoperable identity infrastructure for e-government services.
- Support national digital economy growth (startup ecosystem, fintech) with trusted ID.
- Promote regional interoperability (Maghreb ID discussions).

## Risks & Challenges
- **Privacy**: Concerns about centralized data access and limited transparency.
- **Inclusion**: Need to reach rural Amazigh communities and informal sector workers.
- **Governance**: Ensuring independent oversight by CNDP amid expanded data sharing.
- **Vendor Dependency**: Reliance on foreign biometric solutions (IDEMIA) plus MOSIP customization.
