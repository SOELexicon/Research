# Alberta Wallet

## Executive Summary
The Alberta Wallet is Alberta's provincial digital identity system, designed as a mobile app-based digital wallet for government-issued documents. Launched in 2023, it represents Alberta's entry into the digital ID space, starting with the Mobile Health Card and planned to expand to other government credentials. The system emphasizes user control, voluntary participation, and advanced encryption, though it has drawn criticism from civil liberties groups over plans to include citizenship status.
