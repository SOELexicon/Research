## Intelligence Assessment

### Technical Authority
Represents significant influence in global digital identity technical standards:

**Expertise Areas:**
- Deep technical knowledge of cryptographic identity systems
- Practical implementation experience with large-scale deployments
- Standards development process and international coordination
- Industry-government-academia bridge building

**Influence Mechanisms:**
- **Standards Development**: Direct participation in W3C and other technical specifications
- **WEF Platform**: High-visibility international policy-technology integration
- **Industry Consultation**: Corporate and government implementation guidance
- **Academic Research**: Technical foundation development for identity systems

### Policy-Technology Integration
Unique position at intersection of technical development and international policy:
- **Government Relations**: National digital ID initiative consultation
- **Corporate Strategy**: Enterprise identity platform architecture guidance
- **International Coordination**: Cross-border interoperability standard development
- **Academic Bridge**: Research-to-implementation translation

### Privacy and Surveillance Implications
Technical work directly impacts global surveillance capabilities:

**Privacy-Enhancing Potential:**
- Cryptographic standards enabling data minimization
- Decentralized architecture reducing central surveillance points
- User-controlled credential management systems
- Zero-knowledge proof integration for privacy preservation

**Control Mechanism Risks:**
- Technical standards may embed surveillance capabilities
- Corporate platform influence on ostensibly "open" standards
- Government backdoor requirements in implementation guidance
- Complexity barriers preventing independent verification

## Current Projects

### WEF Digital ID Initiative
- Technical architecture refinement for decentralized systems
- International standards harmonization coordination
- Government implementation guidance development
- Private sector adoption framework creation

### Centre Platform Development
- Digital dollar infrastructure technical standards
- Financial services identity verification systems
- Cross-border payment identity requirements
- Regulatory compliance framework integration

## Open Questions
- [ ] How do technical standards prevent government surveillance backdoors?
- [ ] What is the relationship between Centre's financial focus and identity standards?
- [ ] How does WEF coordination impact independent technical development?
- [ ] What safeguards exist against corporate capture of standards processes?
