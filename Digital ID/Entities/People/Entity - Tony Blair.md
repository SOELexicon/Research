# Tony Blair

## Overview
Sir Anthony Charles Lynton Blair served as UK Prime Minister from 1997-2007, becoming the longest-serving Labour Prime Minister with three consecutive election victories. His legacy is defined by the contradiction between significant domestic achievements including the Good Friday Agreement and constitutional reforms, and the catastrophic 2003 Iraq War based on flawed intelligence. Post-premiership, he has built a vast commercial empire advising corporations and authoritarian regimes while simultaneously advancing global digital ID implementation through his Oracle-funded institute, representing one of the most systematic monetizations of public office in modern democratic history.
