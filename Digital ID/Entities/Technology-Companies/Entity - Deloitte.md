The firm collaborated directly with the [[Entity - World Economic Forum]] to produce the influential **"A Blueprint for Digital Identity" (2016)** report, which established the foundational corporate-led framework for global digital ID implementation and argued that "financial institutions are well positioned to drive the creation of digital identity systems."

## Role in Digital Identity-Industrial Complex

### WEF Blueprint for Digital Identity (2016)
Deloitte's collaboration with WEF on **[[Event - WEF Blueprint for Digital Identity Publication 2016]]** was a pivotal moment in DIIC architecture:

**Key Arguments:**
- Financial institutions are "well positioned to drive the creation of digital identity systems"
- Business case based on efficiency gains and new revenue opportunities
- Private sector should lead, with government as enabler
- Digital ID as foundation for Fourth Industrial Revolution

**Impact:**
This report established the **corporate-led framework** that has guided digital ID implementation globally, positioning private companies as primary drivers rather than neutral service providers.

### Consulting-to-Implementation Pipeline
Deloitte exemplifies the [[Finding - Policy-to-Procurement Pipeline TBI-Oracle Model]]:

1. **Policy Development**: Help government develop digital ID strategy
2. **Standards Setting**: Advise on technical requirements
3. **RFP Creation**: Assist in procurement specifications
4. **Bid Response**: Compete for implementation contract
5. **System Integration**: Win multi-million dollar implementation contracts
6. **Ongoing Support**: Long-term maintenance and advisory

This creates inherent conflicts of interest where the firm shapes requirements that favor its own capabilities.
