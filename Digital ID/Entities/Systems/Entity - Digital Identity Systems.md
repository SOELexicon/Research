# Entity - Digital Identity Systems

## Overview
Digital Identity Systems represent a global infrastructure framework for electronic identification, authentication, and authorization of individuals through digital means. While ostensibly designed for convenience and security, these systems increasingly function as comprehensive population surveillance and control mechanisms, enabling unprecedented state monitoring, financial exclusion, and social engineering capabilities.

## System Architecture and Components

### **Core Technical Infrastructure**
- **Biometric Collection**: Fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, voice patterns
- **Identity Verification**: Document scanning, knowledge-based authentication, device binding
- **Credential Management**: Digital certificates, cryptographic keys, blockchain attestations
- **Authentication Mechanisms**: Multi-factor authentication, continuous verification, behavioral biometrics
- **Data Storage**: Centralized databases, distributed ledgers, cloud infrastructure

### **Implementation Models**
1. **Centralized Systems**: Government-controlled databases with direct state access
2. **Federated Systems**: Multi-organization networks with shared verification protocols
3. **Decentralized Systems**: User-controlled credentials with cryptographic verification
4. **Hybrid Architectures**: Combined approaches optimizing control and user experience

### **Integration Platforms**
