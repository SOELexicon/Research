# Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment

## Overview
The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) was a proposed outdoor geoengineering research project by [[Entity - Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program]] designed to test stratospheric aerosol injection technologies through controlled atmospheric experiments. The project became a symbol of the geoengineering governance crisis when it was cancelled in 2021 following Indigenous opposition led by the [[Entity - Saami Council]] and was permanently abandoned in 2024, establishing important precedents for Indigenous consultation requirements and demonstrating the fundamental conflicts between technological intervention approaches and Indigenous environmental worldviews.

## Project Details
- **Full Name**: Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment
- **Lead Institution**: [[Entity - Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program]]
- **Principal Investigators**: David Keith, Frank Keutsch
- **Proposed Location**: Esrange Space Center, Kiruna, Sweden
- **Project Timeline**: 2014-2024 (cancelled)
- **Funding**: Private foundations and government grants

## Scientific Objectives and Design
### Research Goals
- **Aerosol Behavior**: Study behavior of stratospheric aerosols under controlled conditions
- **Chemical Interactions**: Investigate atmospheric chemistry effects of injected particles
- **Optical Properties**: Measure reflectivity and radiation interaction of aerosols
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential negative consequences of stratospheric injection

### Experimental Design
- **Balloon Platform**: High-altitude balloon carrying experimental equipment
- **Controlled Release**: Small-scale release of particles (calcium carbonate, sulfates)
- **Measurement Systems**: Instruments to monitor aerosol behavior and atmospheric effects
- **Safety Protocols**: Limited scale and controlled conditions to minimize risks

### Technical Specifications
- **Altitude**: Approximately 20 kilometers in stratosphere

- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive atmospheric measurement and tracking systems

## Governance Crisis and Opposition
### Indigenous Rights Opposition
- **[[Entity - Saami Council]] Leadership**: Primary opposition from Indigenous rights organization
- **Traditional Territory**: Proposed experiments affecting Saami traditional lands
- **Consultation Failure**: Inadequate Indigenous engagement in research planning
- **Environmental Justice**: Concerns about technological intervention without consent

### Opposition Arguments
- **Consent Requirements**: Need for free, prior, and informed consent from affected Indigenous peoples
- **Environmental Risk**: Potential negative consequences for traditional territories and practices
- **Governance Inadequacy**: Absence of adequate oversight and accountability mechanisms
- **Technological Imperialism**: Imposition of Western technological solutions without consultation

### Governance Framework Absence
- **International Law**: No adequate legal framework for governing outdoor geoengineering research
- **National Oversight**: Limited regulatory authority over atmospheric research
- **Democratic Participation**: Minimal public engagement and consultation processes
- **Risk Assessment**: Inadequate evaluation of potential negative consequences

## Cancellation Timeline

- **Location Selection**: Esrange Space Center chosen for balloon operations

### Opposition Emergence (2019-2021)
- **2019**: Initial public announcement and opposition emergence
- **2020**: [[Entity - Saami Council]] formal opposition and international advocacy
- **2021**: Swedish government review and Indigenous consultation requirements
- **2021**: Project suspension and Sweden experiment cancellation

### Permanent Cancellation (2021-2024)
- **2021**: Sweden experiment permanently cancelled following Indigenous opposition
- **2022-2024**: Failed attempts to relocate experiment to other jurisdictions
- **2024**: [[Event - SCoPEx Permanent Cancellation Harvard]] - Complete project abandonment
- **2024**: [[Entity - Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program]] dissolution

## Indigenous Opposition Analysis
### [[Entity - Saami Council]] Position
- **Sovereignty Rights**: Traditional authority over ancestral territories
- **Environmental Protection**: Responsibility for land and atmosphere stewardship
- **Consultation Requirements**: Right to free, prior, and informed consent
- **Alternative Approaches**: Traditional knowledge and environmental wisdom

### Opposition Strategy
- **International Advocacy**: Global Indigenous rights network mobilization
- **Legal Challenges**: Rights-based arguments against experimental authorization
- **Public Education**: Communication of Indigenous perspectives and concerns
- **Political Pressure**: Government lobbying and policy influence

### Worldview Conflicts
- **Technological vs. Traditional**: Western intervention versus Indigenous harmony approaches
- **Control vs. Cooperation**: Technological domination versus environmental cooperation
- **Expert vs. Traditional Knowledge**: Scientific authority versus Indigenous wisdom
- **Individual vs. Collective**: Western individual rights versus Indigenous collective responsibility

## Legal and Governance Implications
### Precedent Establishment
- **Indigenous Consultation**: Requirement for meaningful Indigenous engagement
- **Consent Requirements**: Free, prior, and informed consent for territorial interventions
- **Governance Standards**: Democratic participation in planetary intervention research
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of potential negative consequences

### International Law Development
- **[[Entity - Convention on Biological Diversity]]**: Geoengineering moratorium enforcement
- **Indigenous Rights**: UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples implementation
- **Environmental Law**: Precautionary principle application to geoengineering research
- **Democratic Participation**: Public consultation requirements for global commons research

### Research Ethics Framework
- **Social License**: Public consent requirements for research affecting communities
- **Environmental Justice**: Equitable consideration of research impacts
- **Precautionary Approach**: Caution in research with potential global consequences
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Meaningful participation of affected communities

## Scientific and Technical Assessment
### Research Value vs. Risks
- **Scientific Merit**: Potential contribution to geoengineering understanding
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of potential negative environmental consequences
- **Scale Considerations**: Limited experimental scope versus global implications
- **Uncertainty Analysis**: Unknown and unpredictable effects evaluation

### Alternative Research Approaches
- **Laboratory Studies**: Controlled indoor experimental research
- **Computer Modeling**: Simulation-based research without atmospheric intervention
- **Observational Studies**: Natural atmospheric observation and analysis
- **Ethical Research**: Research approaches respecting Indigenous rights and environmental protection

### Technology Development Implications
- **Research-to-Deployment**: Potential progression from experiments to full implementation
- **Precedent Setting**: Experimental authorization potentially enabling deployment
- **Technical Validation**: Research providing legitimacy for intervention technologies
- **Commercial Development**: Private sector technology development informed by research

## International Context and Comparison
### Global Geoengineering Research
- **International Programs**: Comparison with other national geoengineering research initiatives
- **Governance Approaches**: Different regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions
- **Indigenous Rights**: Varying recognition of Indigenous consultation requirements
- **Public Participation**: Democratic engagement mechanisms in different countries
