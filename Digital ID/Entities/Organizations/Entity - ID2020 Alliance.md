# ID2020 Alliance

## Overview
The ID2020 Alliance was a global public-private partnership and a key enabler in the [[Investigation - Digital Identity-Industrial Complex Global Architecture]]. Founded in 2016, it functioned as a consortium bringing together corporations (such as [[Entity - Microsoft Corporation]] and [[Entity - Accenture]]), NGOs, and government bodies, all committed to advancing "ethical, privacy-protecting" digital identity systems. In 2023, ID2020 merged with the [[Entity - Digital Impact Alliance]] to consolidate operations.

ID2020's most significant and controversial initiative was the **[[Event - Good Health Pass Collaborative COVID-19 Launch]]** during the COVID-19 pandemic, which demonstrated a core strategy of the DIIC: **leveraging public health crises to pilot, normalize, and build infrastructure for digital credentialing systems** that can later be repurposed for broader applications.

## Organizational Details
- **Legal Name**: ID2020 Alliance
- **Type**: Non-profit public-private partnership
- **Founded**: 2016
- **Headquarters**: New York, [[Entity - United States]]
- **Merged**: 2023 (with Digital Impact Alliance)
- **Tax Status**: 501(c)(3) non-profit

## Founding Members & Partners

### Corporate Partners
- **[[Entity - Microsoft Corporation]]**: Founding member, technology provider
- **[[Entity - Accenture]]**: Founding member, systems integration
- **Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance**: Vaccination tracking integration
- **Rockefeller Foundation**: Founding funder

### Funding Sources
- [[Entity - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] - Primary funding source

- Corporate partners
- National government grants

### Government Partners
- Multiple national governments (partnerships non-public)
- United Nations agencies

## Mission & Stated Objectives

### Official Mission
"To enable access to digital identity for all individuals, with a focus on the world's most vulnerable populations."

### Key Principles (Claimed)
- **User Control**: Individuals should own and control their identity
- **Privacy Protection**: Minimize data collection and sharing
- **Portable Identity**: Interoperable across borders and systems
- **Inclusion**: Focus on undocumented populations

### Strategic Reality
Despite privacy rhetoric, ID2020's work advanced the infrastructure for:
- **[[Finding - CBDC Programmable Money Control Mechanisms]]**: Identity layer for financial control
- **[[Finding - Function Creep Welfare to Surveillance Repurposing]]**: Single identity for all services
- **Crisis-Driven Implementation**: [[Psyop - Indicator Crisis Exploitation]]

## Good Health Pass Collaborative

### [[Event - Good Health Pass Collaborative COVID-19 Launch]]
ID2020's highest-profile initiative brought together **over 125 companies** from health, technology, and travel sectors to develop standards for **digital health passes** during COVID-19.

**Participating Sectors:**
- Airlines and travel companies
- Technology firms (Microsoft, Oracle, others)
- Healthcare providers
- Verification service providers
- Biometric identity companies

**Technical Standards:**
- QR code-based digital credentials
- Verifiable vaccination status
- Interoperable across borders
- Integration with existing identity systems

### Crisis Exploitation Strategy
The Good Health Pass initiative exemplifies [[Finding - ID2020 COVID Health Pass Crisis Exploitation]]:

**Pattern:**
1. **Crisis Emerges**: COVID-19 pandemic creates fear and urgency
2. **"Solution" Proposed**: Digital health passes for "safe reopening"
3. **Rapid Deployment**: Emergency authorization bypasses normal oversight
4. **Infrastructure Built**: Digital credentialing systems established
5. **Permanent Repurposing**: Infrastructure remains for other uses

**Long-Term Impact:**
- Normalized digital credentialing for everyday activities
- Built consumer acceptance of showing digital ID to access services
- Established technical infrastructure for future credential systems
- Created vendor ecosystem for ongoing digital ID services

## Role in Digital Identity-Industrial Complex

### Public-Private Partnership Model
ID2020 exemplifies the DIIC strategy of blurring lines between corporate interests and public policy:

**Structure:**
- **Corporate Members**: Direct financial stake in digital ID market growth
- **Non-Profit Status**: Tax-exempt, "public good" positioning
- **Government Partnerships**: Access to policymakers and regulatory influence
- **Foundation Funding**: [[Entity - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] strategic interests

**Conflicts of Interest:**
- Microsoft and Accenture members benefit from government digital ID contracts
- "Privacy-protecting" rhetoric while building centralized infrastructure
- Crisis exploitation under humanitarian framing

### Relationship to [[Entity - World Economic Forum]]
- **Aligned Agenda**: WEF's Fourth Industrial Revolution framework
- **Overlapping Membership**: Corporate partners in both organizations
- **Policy Coordination**: Similar messaging on digital ID necessity

## Merger with Digital Impact Alliance (2023)

### [[Entity - Digital Impact Alliance]]
In 2023, ID2020 merged with the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) to consolidate operations:

**Rationale:**
- Streamline global digital ID advocacy
- Pool resources and eliminate duplication
- Unified voice for public-private partnership model

**Continued Agenda:**
- Same corporate members and funders
- Same strategic objectives
- Expanded operational capacity
