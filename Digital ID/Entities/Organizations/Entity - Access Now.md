# Access Now

## Overview
Access Now is an international human rights organization defending and extending the digital rights of users at risk around the world. Through its **#WhyID campaign**, Access Now provides the [[Finding - Access Now WhyID Human Rights Framework]]â€”a comprehensive set of recommendations for ensuring digital ID systems respect fundamental rights.

## #WhyID Campaign: [[Finding - Access Now WhyID Human Rights Framework]]

### Human Rights-Centered Design Principles
Access Now advocates for digital ID systems that are:

1. **Voluntary**: Always optional, with accessible non-digital alternatives
2. **Decentralized**: No centralized government database of biometric data
3. **User-Controlled**: Individuals own and control their identity data
4. **Privacy-Preserving**: Data minimization and selective disclosure
5. **Transparent Governance**: Public oversight and accountability mechanisms
6. **Non-Discriminatory**: Accessible to all, including marginalized populations
7. **Purpose-Limited**: Strict legal prohibitions on function creep
8. **Secure**: Robust technical safeguards against breaches

### Policy Recommendations
- Mandatory **Data Protection Impact Assessments** before any deployment
- Legal frameworks prohibiting mandatory adoption
- Independent oversight bodies with enforcement powers
- Regular audits for bias and exclusion
- Sunset clauses requiring periodic reauthorization

## Global Advocacy Work

### Strategic Interventions
- **UN/International Forums**: Advocacy at UN Human Rights Council, UNHCR
- **National Policy Engagement**: Submissions to government consultations
- **Technical Standards**: Participation in W3C, ISO standards development
- **Litigation Support**: Expert testimony and analysis for legal challenges

### Crisis Response
- Opposition to [[Event - Good Health Pass Collaborative COVID-19 Launch]]
- Analysis of [[Crisis - COVID-19 Pandemic]] exploitation for digital ID expansion
- [[Psyop - Indicator Crisis Exploitation]] documentation
