# Saami Council

## Executive Summary
The Saami Council (Sámi Council) is the representative body for the Indigenous Sámi people across Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Russia, serving as their primary advocate for cultural preservation, land rights, and environmental protection. The organization gained international prominence through its successful opposition to Harvard's SCoPEx geoengineering experiment, demonstrating how Indigenous resistance can halt planetary-scale technological interventions. Their opposition represents fundamental worldview conflicts between Indigenous environmental relationships based on harmony with nature and Western technological approaches seeking mastery over natural systems.
