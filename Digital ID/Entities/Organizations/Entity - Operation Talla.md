# Operation Talla

## Executive Summary
Operation Talla is the UK national policing framework for coordinating the COVID-19 pandemic response, implemented March 12, 2020. Described by [[Entity - Ethical Approach UK]] as "not merely a policing operation, but a structural reconfiguration of law enforcement," Operation Talla established unprecedented centralized information control, multi-year transparency restrictions, and cross-agency coordination that functions as "civil command prototype to enforce compliance, shape public perception, and prepare security infrastructure for future crisis-triggered governance models."
