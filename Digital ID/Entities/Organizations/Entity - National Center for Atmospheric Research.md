# National Center for Atmospheric Research

## Overview
The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is a leading U.S. atmospheric research institution that has become central to climate modeling and geoengineering research through its Geoengineering Large Ensemble (GLENS) project. NCAR plays a pivotal role in developing the scientific foundation for stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) through comprehensive climate modeling that demonstrates both the potential effectiveness and catastrophic risks of planetary-scale atmospheric intervention.
