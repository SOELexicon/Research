# Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project

## Overview
The Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) represents the primary international coordination mechanism for climate modeling of geoengineering interventions, particularly stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). Established in 2010, GeoMIP standardizes research methodologies across global climate modeling institutions while providing the scientific foundation that could justify planetary-scale atmospheric intervention. The project coordinates research across multiple countries and institutions, creating an international consensus framework that potentially enables geoengineering deployment authorization.
