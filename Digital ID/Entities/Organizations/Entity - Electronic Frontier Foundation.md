# Electronic Frontier Foundation

## Overview
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a leading digital rights organization and principled opponent of mandatory national digital identity systems. The EFF maintains that **any centralized government database creates an unacceptable power imbalance and tool for surveillance**, representing the intellectual backbone of resistance to the [[Investigation - Digital Identity-Industrial Complex Global Architecture]].

## Core Position: [[Finding - EFF Mandatory ID Opposition Decentralized Advocacy]]

### Principled Opposition
The EFF opposes **all forms of mandatory national ID**, whether digital or physical:
- **Centralized Databases**: Inherent surveillance architecture
- **Power Imbalance**: Asymmetric government-citizen relationship
- **Function Creep**: Inevitable expansion beyond stated purpose
- **Exclusion Risk**: Technical failures deny fundamental rights

### Advocacy Framework
**Alternative Vision:**
- **Voluntary Systems**: No compulsion to enroll or use
- **Decentralized Architecture**: User-controlled data, no central database
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only absolutely necessary information
- **Purpose Limitation**: Strict legal prohibitions on function creep
- **Anonymity Preservation**: Cash-like privacy for digital transactions

- **Corporate-Led Development**: Private profit from public systems
