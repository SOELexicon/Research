# Make Sunsets

## Overview
Make Sunsets is a controversial commercial geoengineering startup that has conducted unauthorized stratospheric aerosol injection operations, launching sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere without regulatory authorization or adequate governance oversight. The company represents a critical example of the geoengineering governance failure, demonstrating how private actors can conduct planetary-scale atmospheric interventions outside any regulatory framework while claiming to address climate change through unregulated technological solutions.

- **Transparency Demands**: Requirements for operational disclosure and accountability

## Geopolitical and Strategic Implications
### Precedent and Normalization
- **Commercial Precedent**: Establishment of private sector atmospheric intervention
- **Regulatory Bypass**: Demonstration of governance framework inadequacy
- **Scaling Potential**: Model for larger unauthorized intervention operations
- **International Imitation**: Potential for similar operations in other jurisdictions

### Sovereignty and Governance
- **National Authority**: Questions about government control over atmospheric intervention
- **International Effects**: Commercial operations affecting multiple countries
- **Democratic Accountability**: Private company authority over planetary systems
- **Global Commons**: Commercial appropriation of atmospheric resources

### Security and Conflict Potential
- **Unilateral Action**: Single actor intervention affecting global climate systems
- **International Tensions**: Potential diplomatic conflicts over unauthorized operations
- **Environmental Weaponization**: Commercial technology applicable to hostile purposes
- **Governance Crisis**: Systematic failure of oversight and accountability mechanisms

## Technical and Environmental Assessment
### Operational Effectiveness
- **Scale Inadequacy**: Operations too small for meaningful climate impact
- **Technical Limitations**: Insufficient capability for effective intervention
- **Measurement Absence**: No verification of actual atmospheric effects
- **Professional Standards**: Operations below scientific research standards

### Environmental Impact
- **Unknown Consequences**: No assessment of potential negative environmental effects
- **Atmospheric Chemistry**: Uncertain impacts on stratospheric chemical processes
- **Ecosystem Effects**: No evaluation of intervention impacts on biological systems
- **Long-term Risks**: Unknown cumulative effects of continued operations

### Safety and Risk Analysis
- **Risk Assessment Absence**: No systematic evaluation of potential dangers
- **Emergency Protocols**: Lack of contingency plans for negative consequences
- **Monitoring Systems**: No atmospheric impact measurement capabilities
- **Public Health**: Unknown potential effects on human health and safety

## Legal Analysis and Implications
### Regulatory Framework Gaps
- **Federal Authority**: Unclear jurisdiction over atmospheric intervention
- **Environmental Law**: Potential violations of Clean Air Act and other statutes
- **Commercial Regulation**: Absence of business oversight for geoengineering operations
- **International Coordination**: Limited mechanisms for addressing cross-border effects

### Liability and Responsibility
- **Environmental Damage**: Potential liability for negative atmospheric consequences
- **Public Health**: Responsibility for health impacts from intervention operations
- **International Claims**: Potential claims from affected countries
- **Insurance and Bonding**: Absence of financial responsibility mechanisms

### Constitutional and Democratic Issues
- **Due Process**: Public rights to participation in decisions affecting atmospheric commons
- **Equal Protection**: Disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations
- **Environmental Rights**: Constitutional protections for environmental quality
- **Democratic Governance**: Public authority versus private atmospheric intervention

## Intelligence Assessment
### Governance Crisis Demonstration
- **Regulatory Failure**: Complete absence of oversight for commercial atmospheric intervention
- **Democratic Deficit**: Private authority over planetary systems without public consent
- **Accountability Vacuum**: No responsibility mechanisms for intervention consequences
- **International Law Gaps**: Inadequate legal frameworks for commercial geoengineering
