# Good Health Pass Collaborative

## Overview
The Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC) was a consortium of **over 125 companies** from health, technology, and travel sectors, coordinated by [[Entity - ID2020 Alliance]], to develop standards for digital health passes during the [[Crisis - COVID-19 Pandemic]]. It exemplifies [[Finding - ID2020 COVID Health Pass Crisis Exploitation]]â€”using public health emergencies to build permanent digital credentialing infrastructure.

## [[Event - Good Health Pass Collaborative COVID-19 Launch]]

### Participating Sectors (125+ Companies)
- **Airlines**: International travel credential requirements
- **Technology Firms**: [[Entity - Microsoft Corporation]], [[Entity - Oracle Corporation]], others
- **Healthcare Providers**: Vaccination verification systems
- **Verification Services**: Identity and health status authentication
- **Biometric Companies**: [[Entity - Thales]], [[Entity - Idemia]]

### Technical Outputs
- **QR Code Credentials**: Standardized digital health pass format
- **Interoperability Standards**: Cross-border acceptance protocols
- **Identity Integration**: Linkage to existing digital ID systems
- **Verification Infrastructure**: Corporate-controlled authentication networks

## Crisis Exploitation Pattern

### [[Psyop - Indicator Crisis Exploitation]]
1. **Crisis**: COVID-19 pandemic creates fear and travel restrictions
2. **"Solution"**: Digital health passes for "safe reopening"
3. **Rapid Deployment**: Emergency justification bypasses privacy review
4. **Infrastructure Built**: Permanent digital credentialing systems
5. **Repurposing**: Infrastructure remains for future credential applications

### Long-Term Impact
- **Behavioral Normalization**: Acceptance of showing digital credentials for access to services
- **Technical Precedent**: Established interoperable credential standards
- **Vendor Ecosystem**: Created ongoing market for credentialing services
- **Policy Template**: Model for future "emergency" credential deployments
