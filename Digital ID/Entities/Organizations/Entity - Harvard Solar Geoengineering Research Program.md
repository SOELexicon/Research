# Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program

## Executive Summary
The Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program (SGRP) was a prominent interdisciplinary research initiative (2015-2024) that became the most visible and controversial geoengineering research program globally. As the primary institutional backer of the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx), SGRP represented the leading edge of efforts to transition geoengineering research from computer modeling to outdoor atmospheric experimentation. The program's ultimate failure and dissolution following Indigenous opposition and ethical controversies demonstrates the profound social, political, and ethical barriers to geoengineering research progression.
