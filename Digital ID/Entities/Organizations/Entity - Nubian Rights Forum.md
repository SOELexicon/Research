# Nubian Rights Forum

## Overview
The Nubian Rights Forum is a Kenyan human rights organization representing the Nubian community, a marginalized ethnic minority. The organization led the successful constitutional challenge against [[Entity - Kenya Huduma Namba System]], achieving the landmark [[Event - Kenya Huduma Namba DPIA Requirement Ruling]].

## Kenya Huduma Namba Litigation Victory

### Constitutional Challenge
Led litigation arguing:
- **Exclusion of Marginalized**: System would exacerbate discrimination against Nubians who already face identity document barriers
- **Centralized Database**: Massive surveillance and privacy violation risks
- **No Data Protection**: Government failed to enact safeguards before collection
- **Unconstitutional Data**: DNA and GPS collection violated fundamental rights

### Court Victories
- [[Event - Kenya Huduma Namba DNA GPS Collection Ruling]]: DNA/GPS collection unconstitutional
- [[Event - Kenya Huduma Namba DPIA Requirement Ruling]]: Government "put cart before horse," DPIA required
- **Precedent**: [[Finding - Kenya Litigation DPIA Requirement Precedent]]
