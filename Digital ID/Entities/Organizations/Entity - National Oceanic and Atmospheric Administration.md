# National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

## Overview
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a U.S. federal agency responsible for atmospheric and oceanic research, weather forecasting, and environmental monitoring. In the context of geoengineering, NOAA has developed critical capabilities for detecting unauthorized stratospheric aerosol injection operations and serves as the primary U.S. government agency for monitoring potential planetary-scale atmospheric interventions, representing both scientific research advancement and potential surveillance infrastructure development.
