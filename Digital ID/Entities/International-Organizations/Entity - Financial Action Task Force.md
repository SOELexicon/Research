# Financial Action Task Force

## Overview
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization that sets global standards for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT). FATF's **Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements** are a primary driver for mandatory digital identity systems, as central banks and financial institutions must verify identity to comply with FATF standards.

## Role in Digital ID Expansion
- **KYC Mandates**: Requirement for identity verification in financial transactions
- **CBDC Justification**: Retail CBDCs require digital ID for AML/CFT compliance
- **Global Standards**: 200+ countries/jurisdictions implement FATF recommendations
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Non-compliance results in sanctions and financial system exclusion

## Connection to CBDC Architecture
FATF standards are the **primary justification** for linking digital ID to CBDCs:
- **User Onboarding**: Identity verification for CBDC wallet creation
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Suspicious activity detection requires identity linkage
- **Cross-Border Payments**: International transfers require identity verification
