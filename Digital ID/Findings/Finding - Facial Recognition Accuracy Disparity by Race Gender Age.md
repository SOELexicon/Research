# Finding: Facial Recognition Accuracy Disparity by Race Gender Age

## Summary
Research from [[Entity - National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and [[Entity - Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) consistently demonstrates that **facial recognition algorithms exhibit higher error rates** when identifying women, people of color (particularly Black and Asian individuals), and the elderly. This demographic bias in biometric technology leads directly to [[Finding - Systematic Biometric Exclusion of Vulnerable Populations]] when facial recognition is mandated for accessing essential services.

## Supporting Evidence

### NIST Research
[[Entity - National Institute of Standards and Technology]] studies document:
- **Higher False Rejection Rates** for women, Black individuals, Asian individuals, elderly
- **Algorithmic Bias** rooted in unrepresentative training datasets
- **Persistent Pattern** across multiple commercial facial recognition systems

### GAO Corroboration
[[Entity - Government Accountability Office]] research confirms:
- Demographic accuracy disparities in deployed government systems
- Higher error rates for specific populations
- Concerns about discriminatory impact

### Root Cause: Training Data Bias
**[[Finding - Biometric Technology Demographic Bias Pattern]]:**
- Training datasets predominantly feature white male faces
- Algorithms optimize for majority representation in training set
- Underrepresented demographics experience higher error rates

## Real-World Exclusion Examples

### India Aadhaar Authentication Failures
[[Entity - India Aadhaar System]]:
- **12% authentication failure rate** overall
- Higher for manual laborers (worn fingerprints)
- Higher for elderly (faded biometrics, cataracts)
- **57+ starvation deaths** linked to authentication failures
- [[Event - India Aadhaar Starvation Deaths Begin]]

### Failure Rates by Demographic
Studies show biometric failure rates ranging **12-49%** for vulnerable populations:
- Elderly: Deteriorated fingerprints, iris changes, facial aging
- Manual Laborers: Fingerprints worn smooth
- Women: Higher false rejection rates in facial recognition
- People of Color: Higher error rates across biometric modalities

## Analysis

### Automation of Discrimination
When biometric authentication is **mandatory** for essential services:
- Technology failures become service denials
- Demographic bias becomes structural discrimination
- Individual harm (no food rations, no pension) results from algorithmic decision

### Impossibility of Redress
Unlike human decision-making:
- Algorithm provides no explanation for rejection
- No appeals process for biometric failure
- Individual cannot "prove" their identity if biometric doesn't match
- System treats biometric failure as identity fraud

### Scaling Discrimination
Digital ID systems scale biometric bias to **population level**:
- Millions denied services due to demographic characteristics
- Vulnerable populations disproportionately harmed
- Exacerbates existing inequalities

## Implications for Mandatory Digital ID

### [[Finding - Systematic Biometric Exclusion of Vulnerable Populations]]
If biometric authentication is required for:
- Food rations ([[Entity - India Aadhaar System]])
- Bank accounts ([[Entity - Vietnam Project 06]])
- Mobile phones ([[Entity - Nigeria NIN System]])
- Government services (all digital ID systems)

Then demographic bias in biometrics = **systematic exclusion** of vulnerable populations from:
- Economic participation
- Social safety net
- Communication infrastructure
- Government services

### Contradiction to Inclusion Narrative
[[Finding - Legal Identity SDG 16.9 Conflation with Digital ID]]:
- Digital ID framed as "inclusion" for 1 billion undocumented
- Biometric failures exclude millions from services
- Technology becomes barrier rather than bridge
