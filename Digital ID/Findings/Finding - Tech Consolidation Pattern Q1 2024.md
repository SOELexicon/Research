# Finding: Tech Consolidation Pattern Q1 2024

## Summary
The first quarter of 2024 saw rapid consolidation of digital identity infrastructure among key technology vendors (Microsoft, AWS, Palantir), locking governments into bundled cloud, AI, and identity solutions and crowding out smaller providers.

## Supporting Evidence

### Evidence Set 1
- **Source**: [[Event - Microsoft OneGov 6 Billion Dollar Contract]]
- **Data**: $6B contract creating largest federal vendor lock-in for identity and security services.
- **Reliability**: High.

### Evidence Set 2
- **Source**: [[Event - Amazon Web Services Government Expansion]]
- **Data**: $10B ceiling with $1B savings commitment; AWS Digital Identity Accelerator incentives.
- **Reliability**: Medium.

### Evidence Set 3
- **Source**: [[Event - DOGE Accenture Contract Cancellation 1.4 Billion]]
- **Data**: Accenture pivots to [[Entity - Palantir Technologies]], training 1,000 professionals on Foundry/AIP post-contract cancellation.
- **Reliability**: Medium.

## Analysis
- Consolidation increases switching costs, reduces interoperability, and reinforces corporate control over public sector identity services.
- Aligns with [[Finding - Corporate Vendor Lock-in Architecture 2024-2025]].

## Implications
- Governments risk loss of bargaining power and increased exposure to vendor security failures.
- Necessitates policies promoting interoperability, open standards, and multi-cloud strategies.

## Connections
- Monitored in [[Investigation - Digital ID Acceleration and Corporate Consolidation]].
- Involves [[Entity - Microsoft Corporation]], [[Entity - Amazon Web Services]], [[Entity - Palantir Technologies]].

## Corroboration Needed
- [ ] Track contract renewals and RFPs for diversification.
