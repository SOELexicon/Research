# Finding - UK Domestic Remedy Exhaustion Pattern Demonstrates Institutional Unwillingness to Prosecute COVID-19 Crimes

## Summary
Mark Sexton's systematic pursuit of accountability for COVID-19-related crimes through UK legal channels (Metropolitan Police, High Court, Court of Appeal) resulted in complete institutional rejection at every level. This three-tier pattern of refusal demonstrates UK unwillingness to investigate alleged crimes against humanity, satisfying International Criminal Court (ICC) admissibility requirements under Article 17 of the Rome Statute.

## Pattern of Institutional Rejection

### Level 1: Metropolitan Police (Criminal Investigation)
**December 2021:** Crime Reference Number 6029679/21 filed
- Allegations of serious misconduct in public office
- UK Government COVID-19 response crimes
- Filed by Mark Sexton with legal and medical professionals

**February 2022:** Met Police closed investigation
- Approximately 2 months after filing
- No apparent genuine investigation conducted
- Case closed without prosecution

**Result:** Criminal investigation REJECTED

### Level 2: High Court (Judicial Review)
**June 9, 2023:** Judicial review application filed
- Sought review of Met Police closure of CRN 6029679/21
- Supporting statements provided
- Legal challenge to police refusal to investigate

**November 17, 2023:** High Court dismissed application
- Judge dismissed judicial review
- No detailed public reasoning provided
- Refused to hold Met Police accountable for closure

**Result:** Judicial oversight REJECTED

### Level 3: Court of Appeal (Appeal)
**November 2023:** Appeal filed within one week
- Challenged High Court dismissal
- Final domestic legal remedy
- Last UK institutional accountability option

**March 19, 2024:** Court of Appeal dismissed appeal
- Both application and appeal rejected
- All domestic remedies exhausted
- Cleared pathway for ICC application

**Result:** Appellate review REJECTED

## Three-Tier Institutional Protection Pattern

### Systematic Denial of Justice
**Pattern Identified:**
1. **Investigative Authority** (Met Police) - Refuses to investigate
2. **Judicial Review Court** (High Court) - Refuses to hold police accountable
3. **Appellate Court** (Court of Appeal) - Refuses to overturn judicial protection

**Interpretation:**
- Complete institutional protection of government
- No UK institution willing to investigate COVID-19 crimes
- Systematic denial of justice to victims and complainants
- Three independent institutions reaching same protective conclusion

### Institutional Capture Evidence
- **Met Police:** Executive branch agency refusing to investigate executive crimes
- **High Court:** Judicial branch refusing to review executive branch protection
- **Court of Appeal:** Highest domestic court reinforcing institutional protection

**Conclusion:** UK legal system structurally unable or unwilling to prosecute government COVID-19 crimes

## ICC Admissibility Analysis (Rome Statute Article 17)

### Complementarity Principle
ICC jurisdiction only when national courts are:
1. **Unwilling** to genuinely investigate or prosecute, OR
2. **Unable** to investigate or prosecute

### Evidence of UK "Unwillingness"

**Article 17(2)(a) - Shielding from Criminal Responsibility:**
> "The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility"

**Mark Sexton Case Evidence:**
- Met Police closed case without genuine investigation
- High Court refused to review closure
- Court of Appeal upheld protection
- Pattern suggests shielding government officials from accountability

**Article 17(2)(b) - Unjustified Delay:**
> "There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice"

**Mark Sexton Case Evidence:**
- Case closed within 2 months (no investigation time)
- Judicial review delayed over 5 months before dismissal
- Appeal process took 4 months before dismissal
- Total time: Over 2 years with no progress toward justice

**Article 17(2)(c) - Lack of Independence/Impartiality:**
> "The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice"

**Mark Sexton Case Evidence:**
- Government agencies (Met Police) refusing to investigate government crimes
- Courts refusing to hold government accountable
- No independence from state interests
- Systematic protection inconsistent with justice intent

### Domestic Remedy Exhaustion Satisfied

**ICC Requirement:** All available domestic remedies must be exhausted before ICC jurisdiction

**Mark Sexton Exhaustion:**
- ✅ Criminal complaint to police authority (Met Police)
- ✅ Judicial review of police decision (High Court)
- ✅ Appeal of judicial review (Court of Appeal)
- ✅ No further domestic remedies available

**Explicit Recognition:**
> "Exhausting all domestic procedures is a requirement for any application to the ICC (International Criminal Court)" - Mark Sexton, March 25, 2024

## Strategic Legal Planning

### Anticipated Institutional Rejection
Mark Sexton's legal team explicitly stated ICC application requirement, suggesting:
- Team anticipated UK institutional rejection
- Systematic documentation of each rejection level
- Building case for ICC "unwillingness" criteria
- Planned international accountability from beginning

### Evidence Preservation
Legal team documented:
- Met Police refusal to investigate (CRN 6029679/21 closure)
- High Court refusal to review (Nov 17, 2023 dismissal)
- Court of Appeal refusal to appeal (Mar 19, 2024 dismissal)
- Complete institutional failure trail for ICC

## Comparison to Historical Institutional Failures

### Post Office Horizon Scandal
- Decades of institutional protection
- Hundreds wrongly prosecuted
- Courts repeatedly sided with Post Office
- Justice delayed for decades

### Contaminated Blood Scandal
- Decades of NHS institutional denial
- Thousands killed by healthcare system
- Government cover-up for 40+ years
- Victims denied justice for generations

### COVID-19 Accountability Denial
- Institutional rejection at all levels
- Met Police, High Court, Court of Appeal all protecting government
- Pattern suggests decades of denial ahead
- Justifies international intervention (ICC)

**Conclusion:** UK institutions systematically protect themselves; domestic justice unavailable for state crimes

## Multi-Venue Accountability Strategy

### Mark Sexton's Parallel Efforts
1. **Criminal Law** (Met Police CRN 6029679/21) - ❌ REJECTED
2. **Judicial Review** (High Court) - ❌ REJECTED  
3. **Appeal** (Court of Appeal) - ❌ REJECTED
4. **Medical Regulation** (GMC Rule 12 review) - ⏳ PENDING
5. **Parliamentary Oversight** (via Ethical Approach UK) - ⏳ ONGOING
6. **International Criminal Law** (ICC) - ⏳ PREPARATION

### Rationale
- No single institution willing to act
- Multiple venues increase accountability pressure
- Documents systematic institutional failure
- Builds comprehensive evidence base

## Evidence Available for ICC Application

### Alleged Crimes Against Humanity (Article 7)
1. **Murder** - Article 7(1)(a)
   - 250,000+ excess deaths
   - Scottish Inquiry evidence of care home deaths
   - Vaccine-related deaths
   
2. **Persecution** - Article 7(1)(h)
   - Targeting of elderly and vulnerable
   - Lockdown isolation causing deaths
   
3. **Other Inhumane Acts** - Article 7(1)(k)
   - Forced medical interventions without consent
   - Systematic neglect and starvation
   - Forged DNR orders

### Supporting Documentation
- Metropolitan Police CRN 6029679/21 closure evidence
- High Court dismissal (Nov 17, 2023)
- Court of Appeal dismissal (Mar 19, 2024)
- GMC complaint evidence (Dr. Francis Boyle affidavit, Pfizer contracts)
- Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry testimonies (systematic elderly killing)
- The Hope Accord (41,221 signatories: 1,283 MDs, 3,474 healthcare professionals)
- Pfizer government contracts (admitting unknown safety/efficacy)
- Informed consent violations (Montgomery v Lanarkshire)

### Widespread and Systematic Nature
**Article 7 Requirements:**
- **Widespread:** 250,000+ excess deaths, millions injured across UK
- **Systematic:** Government policy implementation, not isolated acts
- **Civilian Population:** UK population targeted during COVID-19 response
- **State Policy:** Lockdowns, vaccine mandates, care home protocols all government-directed

## Significance for Global COVID-19 Accountability

### Precedent Setting
- First known systematic attempt to bring COVID-19 policy crimes to ICC
- Establishes model for other countries' victims
- Demonstrates domestic institutional capture globally
- International accountability when national justice fails

### Global Implications
If ICC accepts jurisdiction:
- Other countries' COVID-19 policies potentially reviewable
- International standard for pandemic response accountability
- Protection against future state abuse under health emergency powers
- Precedent for crimes against humanity in medical context

## Legal Team Communication

### Public Transparency
Mark Sexton (March 25, 2024):
> "We will inform you if there are any other developments. Thank you. Mark Sexton, for and on behalf of the legal team."

**Demonstrates:**
- Coordinated legal team strategy
- Public accountability and transparency
- Ongoing legal process
- Community-supported pursuit of justice

### Next Steps Anticipated
1. Prepare Article 15 communication to ICC Prosecutor
2. Compile comprehensive evidence of alleged crimes
3. Submit evidence of domestic remedy exhaustion
4. Request ICC preliminary examination
5. Await ICC Prosecutor assessment

## Institutional Unwillingness Indicators
