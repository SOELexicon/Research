# Finding - Policy-to-Procurement Pipeline TBI-Oracle Model

## Summary
The Tony Blair Institute operates a sophisticated "policy-to-procurement pipeline" that systematically converts corporate funding into government technology contracts by embedding within governments as advisors, shaping procurement requirements from inside, and creating the political conditions that favor Oracle solutions, representing a new model of corporate capture of democratic governance processes.

## Supporting Evidence

### Evidence Set 1: Rwanda Implementation Case Study
- **Source**: [[Research - Digital ID Surveillance Network Research]]
- **Data**: TBI partnered with Rwanda government on digitizing vaccine records project, with promotional video featuring Oracle representative stating "with Oracle we are building the foundations of a digital economy" directly following TBI collaborative work segment
- **Reliability**: A - Promotional video documentation, project partnership records

### Evidence Set 2: Systematic Market Creation Process
- **Source**: [[Research - Digital ID Surveillance Network Research]]
- **Data**: "TBI enters as high-level policy advisor, identifies a 'need' that can be solved with technology, and helps create the conditions for Oracle to be introduced as foundational technology partner"
- **Reliability**: A - Documented project analysis and operational pattern identification

### Evidence Set 3: Government Advisory Embedding Strategy
- **Source**: [[Research - Digital ID Surveillance Network Research]]
- **Data**: TBI's "advisory work with governments, particularly in the Global South" providing "clear case studies of this policy-to-procurement pipeline" with replicable model across jurisdictions
- **Reliability**: A - Multiple project documentation and pattern analysis

### Evidence Set 4: Vendor Lock-in Objective
- **Source**: [[Research - Digital ID Surveillance Network Research]]
- **Data**: Former TBI staffer warns of "practice of advising governments to adopt Oracle's cloud services" creating "vendor lock-in" by "trapping" and "indebting" governments with systems offered "free or at low cost initially but requiring significant future expenditure"
- **Reliability**: A - Direct testimony from former insider with operational knowledge

## Analysis

### Pipeline Operational Mechanism
The policy-to-procurement pipeline operates through a systematic five-stage process:

1. **High-Level Advisory Entry**: TBI leverages political credentials to gain government advisory positions
2. **Problem Identification**: TBI identifies or frames government challenges requiring technological solutions
3. **Solution Development**: TBI develops policy recommendations favoring comprehensive digital systems
4. **Consensus Building**: TBI creates political and public consensus for recommended technological approach
5. **Procurement Facilitation**: Oracle introduced as preferred technology partner for implementation

### Global South Testing Strategy
Analysis reveals systematic use of developing nations as proving grounds:
- **Lower Barriers**: Fewer regulatory and civil society hurdles to surveillance implementation
- **Proof of Concept**: Successful deployments creating credible "success stories"
- **Marketing Materials**: Case studies used to legitimize model in UK/EU markets
- **Risk Mitigation**: Testing approach in lower-stakes environments before major market deployment

### Methodology
Analysis of TBI advisory relationships, Oracle partnership announcements, government procurement timelines, and former employee testimony revealing systematic coordination between policy advocacy and technology procurement.

### Alternative Explanations
1. **Coincidental Alignment**: TBI genuinely helping governments while Oracle happening to provide best solutions
2. **Market Efficiency**: Oracle technology genuinely superior leading to natural selection by governments
3. **Development Aid**: TBI providing legitimate development assistance with technology components

### Confidence Assessment
- **Level**: High
- **Reasoning**: Direct video evidence of coordination, former employee testimony, documented pattern across multiple jurisdictions, clear financial incentive alignment

## Implications

### Democratic Governance Capture
- **Advisory Infiltration**: Corporate-funded entities gaining advisory positions within government decision-making
- **Procurement Manipulation**: Shaping government requirements to favor specific corporate solutions
- **Democratic Bypass**: Avoiding competitive procurement through advisory influence and consensus manipulation
- **Public Interest Displacement**: Corporate commercial interests displacing genuine public policy development

### Market Distortion Effects
- **Competition Elimination**: Pipeline preventing genuine competition between technology providers
- **Innovation Suppression**: Predetermined solutions reducing incentive for alternative innovation
- **Price Manipulation**: Vendor lock-in enabling post-contract price increases without competition
- **Quality Degradation**: Lack of competitive pressure reducing incentive for service quality

### International Development Implications
- **Dependency Creation**: Developing nations becoming dependent on foreign corporate technology
- **Resource Extraction**: Aid and development funds flowing to foreign corporations rather than domestic capacity
- **Sovereignty Erosion**: National capacity building replaced by foreign technology dependency
- **Digital Colonialism**: Technology dependencies creating new forms of international control

## Case Study Analysis: Replicable Pipeline Model

### Rwanda Digital Economy Foundation
- **TBI Entry**: High-level partnership with Rwandan government on digital transformation
- **Problem Framing**: COVID-19 vaccine record digitization as urgent modernization need
