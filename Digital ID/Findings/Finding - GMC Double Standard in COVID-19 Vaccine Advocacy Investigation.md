# Finding - GMC Double Standard in COVID-19 Vaccine Advocacy Investigation

## Summary
The General Medical Council (GMC) demonstrates a systematic double standard in its investigation of doctors regarding COVID-19 vaccine advocacy: TV doctors who promoted vaccines while receiving pharmaceutical funding were not investigated despite complaints, while independent doctors who challenged the vaccine narrative and refused pharmaceutical funding were investigated or remain under investigation.

## Pattern Identified

### Doctors NOT Investigated (Pro-Vaccine Advocacy)
**Characteristics:**
- TV medical presenters with high public profile
- Promoted COVID-19 vaccines as "safe and effective"
- Received payments from pharmaceutical industry
- Followed government/public health guidance without independent research
- Made public statements via broadcast media

**Named Doctors:**
- [[Entity - Dr Hilary Jones]]
- [[Entity - Dr Ranjit Singh]]
- [[Entity - Dr Sarah Jarvis]]

**GMC Response to Complaint:**
- Declined to investigate
- Stated no evidence of deliberately misleading public
- Noted opinions "not contrary to public health advice at the time"
- No evidence payments influenced treatment of own patients
- Referred complainant to Ofcom and MHRA instead

### Doctors Investigated (Anti-Vaccine Advocacy)
**Characteristics:**
- Conducted independent research on vaccine safety
- Raised concerns about vaccine harms and deaths
- Refused pharmaceutical industry funding
- Honored Hippocratic oath - prioritized patient safety
- Challenged government narrative based on evidence
- Risked careers, reputations, and financial security

**Named Doctors:**
- [[Entity - Dr Aseem Malhotra]] - Testified in Helsinki courts about vaccine harms
- [[Entity - Dr David Cartland]] - Raised vaccine safety concerns
- [[Entity - Dr Mohammed Adil]] - Raised vaccine safety concerns
- [[Entity - Dr Sam White]] - Raised vaccine safety concerns (may still be under investigation)

**GMC Response:**
- Investigated or remain under investigation
- Subjected to fitness-to-practise inquiries
- Treated as potentially unfit to practise for challenging narrative

## Regulatory Failure Analysis

### GMC's Stated Role vs. Actions
**Stated Role:**
- Protect public safety
- Ensure doctors meet standards
- Take action when public confidence at risk
- Support good, safe patient care

**Actual Actions:**
- Did not investigate doctors with pharmaceutical conflicts of interest
- Investigated doctors who prioritized patient safety over profit
- Deferred responsibility to other agencies (Ofcom, MHRA, Department of Health)
- Ignored evidence of:
  - Pfizer contracts admitting unknown long-term effects
  - 250,000+ excess deaths
  - Millions of vaccine injuries
  - Lack of informed consent (Montgomery v Lanarkshire 2015)

### Legal and Ethical Issues Raised

**Informed Consent Failures:**
- Doctors not disclosing per Montgomery v Lanarkshire 2015:
  - Experimental nature of mRNA vaccines
  - Unknown long-term safety and efficacy
  - 1000+ possible side-effects
  - Manufacturer legal indemnity
  - Patients are trial participants
  - Suppressed alternative treatments

**GMC Institutional Liability:**
- Potentially liable for Corporate Manslaughter
- Potentially guilty of Misconduct/Misfeasance in public office
- Failed duty to 380,000 registered doctors (Â£455 annual fee each)
- May have breached contract with registered members
- Insurance policies may be void due to failure to act

## Evidence Supporting Double Standard

### Pharmaceutical Industry Influence
- TV doctors received pharmaceutical payments
- Independent doctors refused pharmaceutical funding
- GMC protected doctors with industry ties
- GMC investigated doctors without industry ties

### Accuracy of Positions (Retrospective)
**TV Doctors' Claims:**
- Vaccines "100% safe and effective"
- Evidence now shows: not safe, not effective, unknown long-term effects
- Government contracts admit efficacy unknown
- Prime Minister Rishi Sunak dropped "effective" from public statements

**Independent Doctors' Claims:**
- Raised concerns about safety and efficacy
- Called for informed consent
- Warned of serious harms and deaths
- Evidence vindicated their positions:
  - Pfizer contracts admit unknown effects
  - 74% of 325 autopsies showed vaccine-caused death (Lancet)
  - Vaccines never tested for transmission (Pfizer admission)
  - Kansas AG suing Pfizer for lying about safety
  - 41,221 signers of Hope Accord (1,283 MDs, 3,474 healthcare professionals)

### Dr Francis Boyle Affidavit
- Harvard law professor, drafted 1989 Biological Weapons Act
- Sworn affidavit: COVID-19 mRNA injections are bioweapons/WMD
- Asserts injections violate bioweapons laws
- Characterizes vaccination program as state terrorism

## Implications

### For Medical Regulation
- GMC appears captured by pharmaceutical/government interests
- Regulatory inversion: protecting industry over patients
- Chilling effect on doctor independence and patient advocacy
- Undermines public confidence in medical regulation

### For Public Health
- Doctors deterred from raising safety concerns
- Informed consent systematically violated
- Patient safety subordinated to policy/profit
- Public misled about vaccine risks

### For Democracy and Rule of Law
- Regulatory bodies failing oversight function
- Post Office and Contaminated Blood scandal parallels
- Decades of cover-up and denial precedent
- Victims denied justice while regulatory capture persists
