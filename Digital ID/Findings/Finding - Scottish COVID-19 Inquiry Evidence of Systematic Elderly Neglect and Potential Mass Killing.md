# Finding - Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry Evidence of Systematic Elderly Neglect and Potential Mass Killing

## Summary
The Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry (October 2023 - May 2024) documented systematic neglect, starvation, dehydration, and potentially unlawful killing of elderly and vulnerable populations in care settings during COVID-19 lockdowns. Testimonies suggest deaths attributed to COVID-19 were actually caused by enforced isolation, medical neglect, and inappropriate end-of-life sedation administered as part of government policy.

## Critical Evidence

### Legal Assessment by Shelagh McCall KC
Queen's Counsel Shelagh McCall summarized family testimonies:
> "Many families witnessed remotely a significant deterioration of their loved ones physical and mental health in lockdown that was NOTHING to do with COVID-19. Some suspect that their loved one was suffering from NEGLECT, DEHYDRATION and STARVATION."

### Systematic Harms Documented
1. **LOCKDOWN/ISOLATION** - Forced separation from family advocates
2. **MEDICAL NEGLECT** - Denial of proper medical care
3. **DETERIORATION** - Rapid physical and mental health decline unrelated to COVID-19
4. **STARVATION** - Systematic withholding or inadequate provision of food
5. **DEHYDRATION** - Systematic withholding or inadequate provision of fluids
6. **FORGED SIGNATURE DNRs** - Do Not Resuscitate orders placed without proper consent
7. **NO HUMAN RIGHTS** - Systematic violations of basic rights
8. **NO POWER OF ATTORNEY** - Family legal authority deliberately ignored
9. **MISSING MEDICAL RECORDS** - Critical documentation disappeared

## Pattern Analysis

### Death Causation Reversal
**Official Narrative:** Elderly died from COVID-19
**Inquiry Evidence:** Elderly died from systematic neglect, isolation, starvation, and inappropriate sedation

### Mechanism of Death
According to testimony analysis:
1. Elderly isolated from family oversight
2. Neglect causes distress and anxiety
3. Distress managed with end-of-life sedation (rather than proper care)
4. Sedation combined with food/water deprivation causes death
5. Death certified as "COVID-19" despite no viral causation

### Government Policy Driven
- Not isolated incidents of individual malpractice
- Systematic implementation across care facilities
- Protected by official COVID-19 emergency policies
- Healthcare workers following directives, not acting independently
- Families legally prevented from intervention

## Historical Parallels

### Nazi Germany Comparison
Multiple witnesses and commenters drew explicit parallels:
> "It is like listening to testimony coming out of Germany in the 1930s, utterly shocking and shameful." - Amat (commenter)

**Similarities:**
- State-sanctioned elimination of vulnerable populations
- Medical participation in systematic killing
- Bureaucratic cover-up through false documentation
- Denial of basic human rights under emergency powers
- Dehumanization of victims as "burdensome"

### T4 Euthanasia Program Parallels (1939-1945)
Nazi program killing 70,000-275,000 disabled/elderly:
- Medical facilities used for killing
- Forged death certificates
- Families denied access
- "Mercy killing" justification
- End-of-life sedation (phenol injections)

**Scottish Inquiry Evidence:**
- Care facilities used for systematic neglect
- Questionable death certifications (COVID-19)
- Families denied access and oversight
- "Protecting vulnerable" justification
- End-of-life sedation (inappropriate palliative care)

## Legal Implications

### Criminal Offenses Potentially Evidenced
1. **Murder/Manslaughter** - Deliberate acts causing death
2. **Corporate Manslaughter** - Systematic organizational killing
3. **Fraud** - Forged DNR signatures, false death certificates
4. **Deprivation of Liberty** - Unlawful detention and isolation
5. **Misconduct in Public Office** - Government officials implementing policy
6. **Assault** - Forced medication/sedation without consent
7. **Conspiracy** - Coordinated systematic implementation

### Human Rights Violations
- **Article 2 (Right to Life):** Deaths through deliberate neglect
- **Article 3 (Torture/Inhuman Treatment):** Starvation, dehydration, forced isolation
- **Article 5 (Liberty):** Unlawful detention in care facilities
- **Article 8 (Family Life):** Denial of family contact and advocacy

### Medical Ethics Violations
- **Hippocratic Oath:** "First, do no harm"
- **Informed Consent:** DNRs placed without proper authorization
- **Duty of Care:** Systematic neglect and abandonment
- **Medical Records:** Destruction or disappearance of evidence

## Institutional Cover-Up

### Media Blackout
- **Mainstream Media:** Poor coverage or complete silence
- **Alternative Media:** Largely ignored (except TNT Radio)
- **Scottish MSPs:** No public comment or action
- Suggests coordinated suppression of evidence

### Citizen Journalism Response
- biologyphenom (Substack) compiled months of testimony
- Independent journalists filling critical gap
- @TheRustler83 providing Scottish coverage
- Freedom Podcast documenting evidence
- Mark Sexton amplifying through social media

### Inquiry Uniqueness
Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry described as:
> "The world's only official COVID-19 inquiry to reveal the truth about what happened during lockdown hearing from families first hand."

**Implications:**
- Other national inquiries avoiding victim testimony
- Focus on policy justification rather than harm documentation
- Scottish inquiry uniquely truth-seeking rather than whitewashing

## Iatrogenic Death Scale

### Definition
**Iatrogenic:** Harm or death caused by medical treatment or healthcare system intervention

### Expert Commentary
Martin Neil (statistician/risk expert):
> "I have no idea why this continues to be ignored by those who claim to be on our side. It is as if they want to deny the scale of iatrogenic harms in order to exaggerate the dangers from the virus."

### Implications for COVID-19 Death Statistics
- Unknown proportion of "COVID-19 deaths" actually iatrogenic
- Deaths caused by lockdown policy, not virus
- Inflated COVID-19 mortality used to justify continued harmful policies
- Circular justification: harm caused by policy → attributed to virus → justifies more harmful policy

## Mark Sexton's Assessment
Former police officer Mark Sexton characterized evidence as:
> "Mass murder of our beautiful elderly at the hands of doctors, nurses and carers all driven by government policy"

**Key Elements:**
- **Mass murder** - Systematic, not isolated incidents
- **Government policy driven** - Not individual criminal acts
- **Medical participation** - Doctors and nurses implementing
- **Accountability demanded** - "MUST happen one way or another"

## Comparison to Other Scandals

### UK Institutional Cover-Up Precedents
1. **Post Office Horizon Scandal**
   - Decades of lies and cover-up
   - Hundreds wrongly prosecuted
   - Victims denied justice for years
   
2. **Contaminated Blood Scandal**
   - Decades of denial
   - Thousands killed by NHS
   - Systematic cover-up and victim-blaming

3. **Scottish COVID-19 Care Home Deaths**
   - Emerging evidence of systematic killing
   - Media blackout and official silence
   - Victims' families seeking accountability

**Pattern:** UK institutions systematically protect themselves while victims wait decades for justice

## Related to GMC Complaint

### Connects to Mark Sexton's Medical Regulation Concerns
- GMC investigating doctors who raised COVID-19 concerns
- GMC refusing to investigate doctors who implemented harmful policies
- Regulatory capture protecting institutional interests over patient safety
- Double standard: whistleblowers punished, policy implementers protected

### Informed Consent Violations
Scottish inquiry evidence supports Sexton's GMC arguments:
- Patients/residents not given informed consent for DNRs
- Families' power of attorney ignored
- Medical decisions imposed without discussion of harms
- Montgomery v Lanarkshire ruling systematically violated

## Public Reaction and Emotional Impact

### Testimony Characteristics
- "Harrowing" (multiple sources)
- "Heartbreaking" (Mark Sexton)
- "Hard to watch" (commenters)
- "Shocking and shameful" (witnesses)
- Viewer discretion advised

### Emotional Testimony
Mark Sexton (former police officer):
> "I'm not ashamed to say my eyes filled up more than once watching this."

**Significance:** Even experienced law enforcement officer emotionally affected by testimony severity

### Calls for Accountability
> "Accountability MUST happen one way or another. God bless to all of the deceased and to their heartbroken loved ones who had to endure this nightmare." - Mark Sexton

**Implications:** Determination for justice regardless of institutional resistance
