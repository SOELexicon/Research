# Investigation: Stratospheric Aerosol Injection Global Governance and Risk Assessment

## Overview
Comprehensive investigation into Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) as the most extensively researched yet potentially catastrophic geoengineering proposal for addressing climate change through deliberate planetary-scale atmospheric manipulation. Analysis reveals SAI represents a profound "climate intervention" that would trade familiar climate risks for unprecedented anthropogenic risks including ozone destruction, hydrological disruption, and "termination shock" - potentially creating a planetary "Sword of Damocles" requiring continuous operation for centuries while enabling unilateral deployment by single actors and presenting insurmountable governance challenges.

The investigation establishes that SAI functions as a symptomatic treatment masking rather than solving climate change, allowing ocean acidification to continue while creating novel risks of unprecedented scale. The technology's relatively low cost enables potential "free driver" scenarios where single nations or actors could unilaterally deploy global climate intervention, creating winners and losers while risking international conflict. Most critically, the absence of adequate international governance frameworks creates conditions for potential geoengineering deployment without global consent, representing one of the most significant threats to planetary stability and democratic governance in human history.
