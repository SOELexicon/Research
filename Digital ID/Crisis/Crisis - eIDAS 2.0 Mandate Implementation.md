# Crisis - eIDAS 2.0 Mandate Implementation

## Crisis Overview
The European Union's eIDAS 2.0 Regulation represents a manufactured crisis of "digital identity necessity" designed to create a continental market for comprehensive digital surveillance infrastructure under the guise of digital transformation and interoperability. The mandate requires all 27 EU Member States to offer European Digital Identity Wallets by 2026, creating guaranteed demand for Oracle and partner technology solutions while establishing pan-European surveillance capabilities.
