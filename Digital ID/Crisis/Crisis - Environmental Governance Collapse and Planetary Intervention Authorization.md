# Crisis - Environmental Governance Collapse and Planetary Intervention Authorization

## Overview
The environmental governance collapse crisis represents the systematic failure of international institutions to develop adequate frameworks for managing planetary-scale technological interventions, creating conditions where unilateral actors can deploy global atmospheric manipulation without democratic consent or adequate risk assessment. This governance vacuum, combined with climate emergency pressures, enables the potential authorization of unprecedented technological interventions in Earth's atmospheric systems despite catastrophic risks, fundamental ethical concerns, and complete absence of global democratic mandate.

The crisis encompasses the breakdown of traditional environmental governance models when confronted with proposed planetary-scale technological interventions like Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), revealing how climate emergency can be exploited to bypass normal democratic deliberation and authorize interventions affecting all life on Earth. The absence of adequate legal frameworks, democratic participation mechanisms, and risk assessment capabilities creates existential threats to planetary stability and democratic governance.
