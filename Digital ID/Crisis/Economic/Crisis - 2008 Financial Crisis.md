# Crisis: 2008 Financial Crisis

## Overview
The 2008 global financial crisis served as a critical justification for expanding financial surveillance infrastructure, banking system control, and regulatory frameworks that provide the foundation for current Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and programmable money control mechanisms.

## Crisis Exploitation Mechanism

### Financial Emergency Justification
- **Systemic Risk Prevention**: Financial crisis justifying comprehensive banking and payment system monitoring
- **Regulatory Emergency**: Crisis enabling rapid expansion of financial surveillance and control authorities
