# Crisis: Authoritarian Axis Formation

## Overview
The coordination between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea in developing and sharing authoritarian control technologies creates the justification for Western adoption of identical surveillance and population control systems. This crisis enables the [[Entity - Bilderberg Group]] to coordinate the implementation of authoritarian digital infrastructure across Western democracies under the pretense of competitive necessity, effectively eliminating the technological and governance distinctions between authoritarian and democratic systems.

## Crisis Structure and Exploitation
