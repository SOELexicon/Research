# Crisis - Canada External Threat Exploitation Digital Control Authorization

## Overview

The Canada External Threat Exploitation Digital Control Authorization Crisis represents systematic exploitation of external threats from the Trump administration to authorize enhanced government digital capabilities and surveillance infrastructure. This crisis demonstrates how external threats are manufactured or exploited to bypass democratic resistance to surveillance expansion, shift electoral outcomes, and enable digital control implementation under security justifications.

The crisis encompasses the Trump administration's tariff threats and annexation comments that shifted Canadian public mood from domestic "scarcity" concerns to national "precarity" fears, enabling the Carney government to win election despite poor domestic economic performance and advance digital identity systems under security justifications. This represents a textbook case of external threat exploitation for democratic bypass and surveillance authorization.
